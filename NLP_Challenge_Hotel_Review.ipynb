            "b'3_west_club ,Feb-27-2009 ,\"\\t   The history the class the location... this hotel was an amazing part of my vacation The hotel\\'s really part of the Republican National Women\\'s Club, which made me apprehensive at first, but it was definitely worth it. The building filled with young d\\xe9butantes and their mothers the last day we were there, which might have been the only bad thing that happened. The location was incredible, and our view was of St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral and Radio City Music Hall. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'3_west_club ,Dec-31-2008 ,\"\\t   Awesome location and a great little find! We stayed at the 3 West Club in October 2008. It was a steal based on the location. We had been looking for weeks and could find nothing available that fit our budget. We had a group of 4 adults and 2 children (4&amp\",\"7). We had the king suite and it was massive. There is a king size bed, a double pull-out (that was fairly comfortable) and they brought up a roll away for our oldest (our little one shared the king with my hubby and I). So romance it was not, but for our group it was perfect. There were three closets - one in the bathroom, one in the hall and then one in a dressing area off the hall. The staff was always helpful and friendly. It was also very clean. This is not your typical chain hotel though. If your looking for room service, or some of the other amenities that major hotels provide, then this is probably not the place for you. If you want be able to walk out the front door and cross the street to Rockefeller Center, but you\\'re still budget conscience - this is a great place. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'3_west_club ,Jul-15-2008 ,\"\\t   Location Can\\'t Be Beat We recently stayed at the 3 West Club on a Wednesday and Thursday night (June 18-19). I used this hotel as a backup while I was trying to get a cheaper hotel on priceline. As luck would have it, there was no inventory mid-week on priceline for our dates, so we ended up staying here. For some reason, prices for that week appeared higher than usual for NYC. As a result, the 3 West Club was one of the better bargains I could get at $214 per night ($247 w/tax) without a long list of negative reviews and scary stories. We were, however, a little hesitant because there were so few reviews, and we could find no other information about the hotel, even on their website. But, we decided to take a chance.Our flight to NYC was very delayed, so I called the hotel and told them we would be very late. They said not to worry, that they would never give a hotel room away when we had a reservation. We ended up arriving at about 3 AM, and they had a room waiting for us.We had a room overlooking W 51st Street on the seventh floor. If you are a light sleeper, the noise from the street could be a problem. We were so tired each night that it really didn\\'t bother us too much, and I am a light sleeper. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the room at that price. If you are looking for luxury, services and amenities in a hotel, I don\\'t think this is the place for you. However, if you need a decent, clean room in an excellent location, this is it. The room was not too small, had a good-sized closet, a decent shower, and a flat panel LCD TV with digital cable and tons of channels.At the time we were there, there was scaffolding on the front of the building, but that really didn\\'t bother us - we didn\\'t notice any active work (i.e., noise from construction) going on while we were there. Through the scaffolding, we could see Rockefeller Center across the street and St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral on the corner. The excellent location of this hotel can\\'t be overstated if you are there to visit many of the tourist attractions.In comparison to the other hotels that were available at this price, I think the 3 West Club is a great deal. I would not hesitate to stay there again. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",

            "b'414_hotel ,Oct-27-2009 ,\"\\t   Sweet touch to NYC !! I spent a quick weekend with my girlfriend in NYC at this place and we both LOVED it! We booked last minute and got a great rate.... our room was so cozy we didn\\'t want to leave. The staff, especially Sakena, were delightful, quick to help and got us a car booked when we left. Like a great home. See you again 414. Best of Luck! \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Oct-7-2009 ,\"\\t   A tad pretentious? But shoot me. The hotel is situated very well for the Upper West side attractions and isn\\'t too far from Central Park. There are lots of bars and restaurants close by, especially in the imaginatively named, &quot\",Restaurant Row&quot,\" (they must have been up all night thinking that one up). Anyhow, I stayed for two nights in the ground floor &quot\",King\\'s Suite&quot,\" (or King\\'s Room...whatever) which was well, good, but not terrific. It was very tired - the kind of place where you knew that if you moved something there may well be something unpleasant behind it. You know the feeling you get in some hotel rooms...? It looked like it needed a good fix-up and was long overdue for it.The one member of staff that I saw there was on reception as I left and was extremely pleasant and helpful. She even spoke English so I knew I wasn\\'t in London. There is no lift (elevator) in the hotel, so if (like a couple of grand old dames I encountered as they checked in) you are roomed on the second floor (that\\'s 3rd in American) you are going to have to not only walk up but carry your bags up yourself too, unless I\\'m there to help you as I happened to be at the time. No-one else seemed keen on the job - certainly no staff made an offer.Breakfast is a basic affair which you have to pour/serve/find yourself. There is only one table to eat at unless you want al-fresco. No, that is not the name of the chef.My bill for two nights was over USD500 which without extras of any kind I thought was maybe a little steep? You decide. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Sep-28-2009 ,\"\\t   Safety is an Issue Great price - great location- renovated room plus bath. Unfortunately, I stayed in a room on the first floor and the window lock was broken. The staff was apologetic and assured me that security camera\\'s were in use and that I was completely safe. The room faced the back courtyard making it accessable to other guests plus anyone willing to jump the fence and push the screen in. I would not stay here again. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Sep-27-2009 ,\"\\t   Excellent Theater Hotel Having travelled enough times to have worn out many suitcases my wife and I make our hotel choices on a number of different factors: central location permitting travel by foot as well as by public transportation\", reasonable cost, clean with private toilet facilities,\" a bit of character. That being said, the 414 qualifies these tests. Manhattan, being the size it is, has many different areas\", the 414 is central to Times Square and the theater district. It is at the end of &quot,Restaurant Row&quot,\" on 46th Street close to 9th. You can walk to almost every theater in minutes and after the performance walk back to the 414. Our cost for a double with minimal continelntal breakfast of coffee, juice, cereal, rolls was $189.00 a night for a double. The rooms are not large nor are they tiny and the 40 inch LCD tv on the wall is a nice touch. The bed is comfortable and the lines crisp and clean. The bathroom is good size. A brownstone type of facade is appealing and 22 rooms is much more acceptable than the 200-400 concrete and metal structures in and around Times Square. The negatives: no elevator and that means you carry your luggage to the 2nd, 3rd or 4th floor\",\" also, this time we noticed a small amount of mold on a shower wall--small is still too much. We will always try to stay here on our theater visits. The money saved will pay for the theater tickets. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Sep-18-2009 ,\"\\t   Charming intimate contemporary subtlely hip yet elegant understated sophisticated Near Restaurant Row and within easy walking distance of busy Times Square, 414 Hotel is a small, calm and intimate haven. From the charming leafy patio with small round mosaic tables, to the smart, sensually pleasing bedrooms with striking photographic cityscapes and sumptuous white down comforters and natural fiber sheets, this hotel is about good taste, intimacy and conviviality. In fact, guests breakfast all together at a long attractively stained table brightened by flowers at each end. It is no wonder that this small, tucked away gem-of-a-hotel attracts many Europeans in addition to folks from the U.S. and other points abroad. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Sep-2-2009 ,\"\\t   Just Neutral Had high hopes for this hotel after reading other reviews. We used to stay in an old brownstone hotel in NYC that was closed 2 years ago and thought that this would compare to it . We were a bit disappointed that it did not live up to our expectations. Room was very bland and small. We were always banging into TV hanging on wall when trying to walk around the bed, it was that close! Fresh paint may perk it up a bit too. Breakfast was ok. Hotel was fine if you get a reasonable rate. Which I believe you can get now. When in lobby we could hear front desk quoting rates and after paying $70 a night more, we felt like we really paid too much for what we got.Would stay here again if our other hotels are booked and we got a great rate. Not a bad hotel, just not as quaint as I expected. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",

Our room was quaint &amp\",\" contemporary. We loved the clock w/the iPod connector. The bed and pillows were awesome, we got a great night\\'s sleep. The only complaint we have is we were awaken@7am by dishes clinking and the lobby chairs scraping across the floor when they were setting up for the free continental breakfast [which continued until it was over at 10] {very disturbing when we got in late Saturday night, and planned on sleeping in} Outside of that, it was great.

The stairs are skinny and you should watch your step, and the breakfast wasn\\'t interesting, and there were certainly funky things about the room, but what I appreciated was how huge this room was. Certainly big enough to share with a friend and it was close to everything and relatively (for NYC) quiet. You can spend twice the price for something that looks better from the outside, but if you can handle a little funk, this is a great place. There are also some rooms across a courtyard that are newer and may have fewer access problems. Next time I\\'m there I\\'ll ask about these rooms. There are great restaurants and bakeries a few blocks away. It\\'s a neighborhood place and it felt comfortable walking to the theater and to subways and bus stops. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",

Hundreds of Ethnic restaurants on the doorstep &amp\",\" an easy 10 minute walk to Times Square. Hotel staff are friendly, helpful &amp\",\" knowledgeable, gave good tips to help us get around town. We had a room on the top floor.... up 3 flights of VERY steep stairs! Luckily a staff member carried our suitcases up &amp\",\" down for us. The room was nicely decorated, looked out over the courtyard (which we had specifically requested), the air-co was a bit noisy but efficient &amp\", there was a great added bonus of a refrigerator in the room. The bathroom was done up nice in black &amp,\" white tiling, overheard a complete converstion from our neighbours though....probably via the ventilation system!! The lobby area doubles up as breakfast room &amp\",\" has free internet access but if you want to print anything you have to e-mail it the hotel as an attachment which they will then print for you at a cost of $2 a page. Breakfast was a nice selection of bagels/croissants/cereals/fruit juice/apples/oranges. Just enough to get you on your way. We ate at the Galaxy restaurant on the corner a couple of times. Open 24 hours, all day breakfasts &amp\",\" super fast service. Enjoyed our stay here for 3 nights, felt we got good value for money. Wouldn\\'t recommend this hotel to anyone with young kids though or anyone not fit enough to cope with the stairs. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",

Our room was on the second floor facing the courtyard and was very quite. The room was a nice size, the bathroom was large. The furniture and linens seemed new and the bed was very comfortable. The windows opened, but no screens. A continental breakfast was served in the lobby - cereal, muffins, juice. We didn\\'t use it but I saw a computer and printer in the lobby for guests. The location was great, right at the end of Restaurant Row with a short walk to Times Square and subway stop. Close to Penn Station. The only small negatives were poor lighting (40 watt bulbs??) and the room could have used a new coat of paint - the walls looked a little dingy. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",

I learned that the hotel recently underwent some renovations and in reality it is actually nicer than the pictures shown on the website.

There is free continental breakfast in the common area (or on the back patio) in the morning, and a friendly vibe that makes this place unpretentious and comfortable.By NY standards the room was decent sized,. Other must-haves these days were present: bathroom was good, good sized TV, free wireless, lots of plugs and windows that open!

Our room was comfortable, and the bath was clean and updated. the headboard on the bed was a bit stained and dirty-looking\",\" that really should be very clean, since it affects one\\'s impression of overall cleanliness.

            "b'414_hotel ,Dec-23-2008 ,\"\\t   Good hotel in excellent location New York is no longer a cheap destination, but the 414 Hotel is probably as good a deal as you can get. Situated in a charming street 5 minutes walk from Times Square, the location of this hotel is hard to beat. Restaurant Row is near at hand and you never need to walk far for an excellent meal or live music.The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Don\\'t be put off by the rather depressing brown stair carpet, its not a good first impression. However the rooms are spacious and comfortably equipped. Rooms are well serviced daily. Yes some of the paint work does need freshening up, but we found our room warm and comfortable. Probably the best hotel bed I have ever slept in. If you take comfortable shoes and warm clothes (in Winter) you can walk to most of the main sites from the 414. Breakfast is included but not worth staying in for. Great cafe on the corner that does the bigest pancakes I have ever seen!In conclusion a good hotel I would be happy to recommend to anyone. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Dec-8-2008 ,\"\\t   Great Location In Midtown Manhattan We spent three nights at the 414 Hotel while enjoying NYC during the Christmas holidays and it was a great place to stay.The location can\\'t be beat for the price. It is a few short blocks to Times Square and a few more from that to Rockefeller Center. There is a subway stop a few blocks away as well. The best part of the location is that the hotel is located right on Restaurant Row so there are dozens of restaurants literally at your doorstep.This boutique hotel had a lot more to offer than the expensive chain hotels you find in every major city. They served a nice breakfast each morning that consisted of fresh croissants, muffins, and juices. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They suggested restaurants and helped us schedule a car to the airport for a great price.The rooms are small but most NYC hotel rooms are. We had seen complaints on TripAdvisor about the noise levels and didn\\'t find any problem with noise while we were there even though the hotel was full.Overall, we would stay here again. The location, price, and comfort definitely added to the enjoyment of our stay in NYC. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",

I was there 6 nights in April and I loved it. the rooms have good size and are very clean, and have plasma TV. The location is excellent, and very near the subway and Times Square. The breakfast is simple but tasty and, in addition gives you a good economy. The price of the hotel, among those over 30 who I researched, was one of the best.The apartments of the building from the bottom are the best because almost have no stairs and are very quiet. I recommend this hotel to all who want to stay in New York without paying a fortune for it.The hotel also offers a computer with internet for guests and the staff is simple but efficient. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Nov-6-2008 ,\"\\t   NY\\'s best kept secret This is a long overdue review. I wanted to keep this hotel my little secret, as it is small, affordable and convenient. NY hotels cost a lot of money, and this place is perfect for a business traveler on a budget. The rooms aren\\'t fancy, and you should not expect great service. But if you want a *quiet*, affordable, relatively clean place to stay, then this is it. I can\\'t believe there are quiet hotel rooms in NYC, but if you request a room in the back building, you will certainly sleep soundly.My brother was passing through and missed a late-night flight. He was due to take a train out of Penn Station the next morning. I called the hotel around midnight, and they had one room left. They took great care of him and he was refreshed and ready to go the next morning, with a quick walk to Penn. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Aug-27-2008 ,\"\\t   Great Little Spot This is a long overdue review. I want to echo the positive comments from others who have booked a room here. I am a NY native who NEVER stays overnight because I live closeby. Knowing how incredibly expensive a one night hotel stay can be, i searched for a budget place that was in a good spot because I was in the city for a 2 day conference with my husband.This is it. Clean, affordable, and just what you need for sightseeing. The place is literally nestled in Restaurant Row (Check out Becco and their fresh pasta symphony...delish!) with dozens of meal options right outside your door. I paid just over 200 bucks for one night and that is a complete STEAL compared to what is out there. Plus, the small continental breakfast was just enough to get you started.The inn will not have all the amenities to be expected from a large hotel. It is an inn\", hence it is smaller and more intimate. We had a room facing the courtyard which was remarkably quiet. Yes there are no elevators so beware heavy packers who get a room beyond the first floor.I would definitely return,\" in fact, i tried booking for Nov. but they were sold out! \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Aug-18-2008 ,\"\\t   Clean pretty well-located I really liked the 414 Inn and stayed there in August 2008. Bedbug-free.There was only a house number, &quot\",\"414,&quot\", on the outside,\" no sign. The lobby was small and included two modern black leather chairs as well as three or four small circular tables, each with two red chairs. The decor was in slate grays, red, black and white. There is a motif of historic photos of NYC throughout the hotel, which was lovely.Breakfast was served from 7-10am and included coffee, tea, croissants and small bagels. The Inn has red and white plates and pretty red mugs (that can also be purchased) for the coffee as well as &quot\",to go cups&quot,\" for coffee on the go.The room was small but clean. Amenities included crisp, white sheets, lightweight down comforter, a mini-fridge and window unit air conditioner. Service was prompt and good. The bathrooms had old-school small hexagonal tile in black-and-white, a white modern pedestal sink and standard shower. There was no closet, but there was a modern rack that easily held clothes that needed to be hung up. There was also a dresser for folded clothes, and two bedside tables. We were on the first floor, but I understand that there are third-floor rooms and no elevator. We also encountered noise as people went in-and-out of the courtyard.The brick-lined courtyard had pretty landscaping and cute tile tables that were of good quality. It was a pleasant space to sit outside and enjoy coffee in the morning. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",

The hotel was fully booked, but never heard anyone else, although I saw folks at breakfast. Enjoyed the continental breakfast which certainly helped with expenses. By New York standards, the room and bathroom were a nice size. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and we slept well every night. When we arrived, the air conditioner was off and it took a while to cool the room, but once cooled, everything was fine. The staff was very nice and helpful. The only drawback to the hotel is no elevator. Also, for some reason, the stairwell and hallways are painted a dark color\", a lighter color would sure make a difference. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",

The room was large and bathroom was very spacious, especially for New York. The air-conditioning worked fine and the desk people were very pleasant.There are no elevators, so be prepared to carry your luggage upstairs...I was on the 3rd floor, there were 2 more levels above me. They are a little short on some amenities, like no place to safely store luggage before or after checking in or out, but have some others that are nice, like free wireless internet, free continental breakfast and kitchen privileges. Overall, they offer a nice quiet stay in a very busy city for a very reasonable price. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Jul-16-2008 ,\"\\t   Great Hotel Great Price (for NY) I recently stayed at the 414 in order to attend a conference at CUNY in Harlem. The 414 was close to the #1 subway train that travel to and from that area, but I also chose the hotel based on its excellent location in Midtown Manhattan near great restaurants, theaters, and Times Square. I arrived around 12 PM, and although I wasn\\'t able to secure an early check-in, the friendly front desk staff assured me that I could leave my suitcase and someone would take it to my room for me. This was actually a great service, as my suitcase was large and heavy, the stairwell was narrow, and it was three flights up to my room on the fourth floor.When I returned a few hours later, my suitcase was indeed in my room as promised. The room itself looked as if it was recently renovated, with a nice large bed, flat screen TV on the wall, and photographs of NY around the room. There were some small issues with the room. There was a little water damage on the ceiling of the room, and some of the grout around the tile above the bathtub was dark. I also found the bathroom sink puzzling, as the water turned on regardless of whether you turned the knobs left or right. Since you needed to manipulate both knobs to avoid very hot or cold water, it made getting the water to stop completely a bit of a trick.To me, these were all very minor inconveniences. I loved my room, especially the comfortable bed. The room felt large enough, and I didn\\'t mind the three flights of stairs one bit even after walking around the city every day. It was also convenient to have WiFi in the hotel, and a computer in the lobby to check email.While this property is listed as a hotel, it could also be considered a bed and breakfast (the awning of the property actually says bed and breakfast). The breakfast is pretty modest, with croissants, muffins, bagels, cereal, coffee, and juices, and usually one type of fruit, such as bananas. But since it was included in the room price, I was happy with what was provided.I think where this hotel excels is the quality of its service. I was particularly impressed with Jessica. She was always very friendly and helpful. She called a car for me on my last day that was as cheap as a cab, but was essentially a limo sedan. I was told it would be $33 with tax and tip, but when I arrived at the airport, the driver informed me it was $33 without tip and without a $5 toll. The ride was fast and comfortable, so I didn\\'t mind paying a bit more.Jessica also helped me print my boarding pass from the hotel, as I was attending a late Broadway performance and had little time to get to the airport once it was over. I felt like she really went above and beyond, especially given the horror stories you hear about rude staff at other hotels.I really recommend this hotel. My colleagues at my conference discussed a variety of other hotels where they were staying, and I think I had the cheapest rate and the best experience. If you can get by without the elevator, I think its a fantastic place to stay and I\\'ll definitely return to the 414 when I\\'m back in NY.Joe SalvatoreSouth Lyon, MI \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",

I really have to say thank you especially to Greg, who was there for us all the time during our stay and answered all our questions. The 414 would not be the same without him!The Hotel lies is a very quiet street and the only thing you can hear in the morning are the birds, that are sitting in the patio. After a wonderful night in a more than comfortable bed you can enjoy the delicious breakfast.All the rooms are very clean and have an attractive design, so that you can feel &quot\",at home&quot,\" from the first time you step into the room.

The bathroom was a nice size, particularly for NYC, with lots of counter space. The room was decorated with large old photos of NY. The street is really cool and quiet, we were awakened by the sound of horse carts clip-clopping down the street. Breakfast until 10 means not having to get up early. We had a little refrigerator in our room. It was inexpensive for NYC. My only complaint was how dark the stairway was (no elevator). Dark carpet, dark walls, no lights.

I was there for a Fashion tradeshow, so I needed to be somewhat close to the Javitz. When on the phone, they were extremely polite... they had to upgrade us to a nicer room b/c they didn\\'t have any 2 twin rooms left (fine with me!). We got a big room (esp. for NYC) near the courtyard, which ended up being very quiet and peaceful. The staff was sooooo nice and helpful, and the property seems very safe. I have told everyone I know who travels to NYC about this hidden little secret. Highly recommended! \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Jan-5-2008 ,\"\\t   good but they still have work to do.... We found the super location, parking easy and cheap, almost all, the service was good, but the breakfast very soso (ordinary.)The room was not so bad, good sheets, a nice bed, a plasma TV. But the carpet of the room was quite dirty, and it\\'s not a good idea to put carpet at this level,(level before 1) we come from outside, and it\\'s very wet, there was rust and dirty and the heating system was defective. I think that they still have work to do, but in general it\\'s pretty nice for the price.... \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",
            "b'414_hotel ,Jan-4-2008 ,\"\\t   Hidden Treasure I stayed in this hotel the week before Christmas and it was so lovely that I nearly did not write a review, in case this hidden treasure gets too popular and booked up!!I have previously stayed in some large mid-price hotels in New York aimed at tourists, which appear to be over-priced, with cramped rooms and in need of updating. So 414 was a very lucky find. It is small (22 bedrooms) and well maintained. It has been refurbished in the last couple of years. Don\\'t be put off by the dark brown paint on the walls of the stairs and hallway, the rooms are bright, light and larger than the average New York hotel room.Unusually for New York a continental breakfast is provided with an excellent choice of croissants, bagels and muffins, fruit or cereals. There is also coffee, tea and juice. It is self-service, mugs are provided for the coffee and teas, and disposable plates / bowls etc for the food. The tea and coffee is available all day as it is not provided in the bedrooms. Breakfast is eaten in the small foyer area in front of a cheery, warming fire.The bedrooms as stated are large, bright and airy, with double glazed windows, and air conditioning units. I stayed in room 402 which was well decorated and had a small fridge, plenty of storage space, an iron, a safe and a very large wall-mounted TV. The bathroom was also quite large and modern with a shower and small bath. Everything was kept spotlessly clean during my stay and the staff were pleasant and very helpful.There is wireless internet access throughout the hotel and a computer guests can use to check e-mails in the lobby. There are also daily newspapers and magazines in the lobby. As it was winter I did not make use of the courtyard garden however I expect this is a wonderful place to breakfast in the summer.All in all I had a wonderful stay. I recommend phoning the hotel direct for a booking as I tried to book through websites but got a better deal for a week long stay by phoning directly. One negative point is possibly the lack of a lift. My room was on the 4th floor which was also the top floor, but remember in the USA the 1st floor = the UK ground floor. I think this lack of a lift might explain why the hotel has not got better \\'star\\' ratings, but if you are OK with stairs then I highly recommend this little hotel which is very handy for Times Square and all the restaurants along 46th Street between 8th and 9th. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n"

There is a king size bed, a double pull-out (that was fairly comfortable) and they brought up a roll away for our oldest (our little one shared the king with my hubby and I). So romance it was not, but for our group it was perfect. There were three closets - one in the bathroom, one in the hall and then one in a dressing area off the hall. The staff was always helpful and friendly. It was also very clean. This is not your typical chain hotel though.

            "Before:  b'3_west_club ,Jul-15-2008 ,\"\\t   Location Can\\'t Be Beat We recently stayed at the 3 West Club on a Wednesday and Thursday night (June 18-19). I used this hotel as a backup while I was trying to get a cheaper hotel on priceline. As luck would have it, there was no inventory mid-week on priceline for our dates, so we ended up staying here. For some reason, prices for that week appeared higher than usual for NYC. As a result, the 3 West Club was one of the better bargains I could get at $214 per night ($247 w/tax) without a long list of negative reviews and scary stories. We were, however, a little hesitant because there were so few reviews, and we could find no other information about the hotel, even on their website. But, we decided to take a chance.Our flight to NYC was very delayed, so I called the hotel and told them we would be very late. They said not to worry, that they would never give a hotel room away when we had a reservation. We ended up arriving at about 3 AM, and they had a room waiting for us.We had a room overlooking W 51st Street on the seventh floor. If you are a light sleeper, the noise from the street could be a problem. We were so tired each night that it really didn\\'t bother us too much, and I am a light sleeper. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the room at that price. If you are looking for luxury, services and amenities in a hotel, I don\\'t think this is the place for you. However, if you need a decent, clean room in an excellent location, this is it. The room was not too small, had a good-sized closet, a decent shower, and a flat panel LCD TV with digital cable and tons of channels.At the time we were there, there was scaffolding on the front of the building, but that really didn\\'t bother us - we didn\\'t notice any active work (i.e., noise from construction) going on while we were there. Through the scaffolding, we could see Rockefeller Center across the street and St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral on the corner. The excellent location of this hotel can\\'t be overstated if you are there to visit many of the tourist attractions.In comparison to the other hotels that were available at this price, I think the 3 West Club is a great deal. I would not hesitate to stay there again. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\r\\n'\n",

Anyhow, I stayed for two nights in the ground floor &quot\",King\\'s Suite&quot,\" (or King\\'s Room...whatever) which was well, good, but not terrific. It was very tired - the kind of place where you knew that if you moved something there may well be something unpleasant behind it. You know the feeling you get in some hotel rooms...? It looked like it needed a good fix-up and was long overdue for it.The one member of staff that I saw there was on reception as I left and was extremely pleasant and helpful. She even spoke English so I knew I wasn\\'t in London. There is no lift (elevator) in the hotel, so if (like a couple of grand old dames I encountered as they checked in) you are roomed on the second floor (that\\'s 3rd in American) you are going to have to not only walk up but carry your bags up yourself too, unless I\\'m there to help you as I happened to be at the time. No-one else seemed keen on the job - certainly no staff made an offer.Breakfast is a basic affair which you have to pour/serve/find yourself.

A brownstone type of facade is appealing and 22 rooms is much more acceptable than the 200-400 concrete and metal structures in and around Times Square.

up after the visit before Expedia did anything This was the worst hotel experience in my life My wife and I were visiting New York for hospital visits and I booked 2 nights in this hotel via Expedia in order that my wife should have a more homely feel and be more relaxed before some medical tests and procedures We arrived at about 9 45 pm on August 9 2005 and elected to check in before finding a restaurant to eat at We had called the hotel to advise that we would be arriving at about that time I will start with complaints that will disgust all future occupants before dealing with the hotel\\\\x92s dreadful behaviour The following is based upon notes that I took at various times during the ordeal that we suffered and is not exhaustive of the complaints that we have I note a limited sample of the problems that of this hotel \\\\xb7The bathroom had a revoltingly rusty radiator which looked like it was falling apart \\\\xb7The bed sheets were stained and filthy We had to request replacement sheets which were left for us to put on the bed ourselves \\\\xb7The so called king size bed is simply 2 single beds pushed together \\\\xb7The headboard affixed to the wall was filthy and did not appear to have been dusted in months \\\\xb7There were holes in the wall of the room \\\\xb7There is a large step before descending into the room which is dangerous and caused me to trip several times \\\\xb7Neither the bathroom light nor the fan were working upon our arrival in the room Only 2 of the 3 bulbs in the external area were working as well so there was little light going into the bathroom and the door therefore had to remain open It is quite disgusting that my wife and I had to use the toilet facilities with the door open to the main room because of the lack of light They repaired it some time during the day of August 10 whilst we were at the hospital together with the non working bulb in the external sink area \\\\xb7There is no working fan in the bathroom \\\\xb7The safe in the room did not work due to a low battery and some of our valuables had to be left at risk This was also repaired some time during the next day Then our suffering started I unloaded the car and then parked it at the advertised parking which is actually that of another hotel and 4 blocks North and 1 block West It has nothing to do with the 414 Hotel and can hardly be described as convenient I mentioned the bathroom light problem to the receptionist who came to have a look She claimed that she could not fix the light until a handyman would arrive sometime after midnight As we had to rise at 6 30 am to get to the medical appointment we said that we could not stay up until after midnight In passing she then mentioned that we should not unpack because we would have to move rooms the next day We were surprised to hear this and she said that we could have all our stuff packed up and the hotel staff would move it for us We advised that this was outrageous We had just traveled 10 hours had to be up early and were to be in a hospital all of the next day and that we were not going to spend any of time unpacking and then packing up again before the noon check out for the hotel\\\\x92s convenience This was the first we had heard of this and would not have agreed to come to the hotel if we had been told We were only going to be there for 2 nights We asked her to call her manager and tell her this whilst we waited in our room The receptionist called us back from the front desk and told us that she had spoken to the manager and that we had to move She advised that we could check out now if we were not happy At 10 30 p m we were not inclined to go looking for another hotel in Manhattan especially when the car was parked some distance away and she said she could not promise any refund since Expedia had received payment in full and they had no access to such monies I then demanded that the manager actually speak to us as we had originally requested I called Expedia at the same time and their call desk said they would call the hotel to find out what was going on and call me back A few minutes later Expedia called my mobile telephone whilst the manager (Sakima Karima) contemporaneously called the room The manager advised us that we would have to move that Expedia was a discount hotel provider and therefore those who paid more had precedence over us She again advised us that if we did not like it we could check out She would even help us find another hotel on the next day This again missed the point that as we were at the hospital all day we would be unable to change hotels or rooms to accommodate their whim I advised that I was not aware that Expedia was a discount provider and the price paid was irrelevant to the level of service to be provided A decent level of service should be provided to all I was absolutely furious and this conversation went backwards and forwards for 10 minutes when she advised me that she ran a wonderful hotel and they had just received another star She threatened that if we did not pack our belongings before heading for the hospital then she would arrange for our belongings to be packed up by the hotel staff It was only when I advised that I would be making our views known as to the level of service to the Expedia site the tourism ministry and warn anyone else to stay away that she claimed that she had wanted to tell me that she would do her best to keep us in the room and that I should leave my mobile number with the front desk in the morning She also claimed that she had told Expedia representatives a few weeks ago that she had the right to move guests around and blamed Expedia for the situation She claimed to have the same problems with a website called hotels com I then picked up the call on my mobile telephone from Expedia who said that she had found out that the hotel could legally move us from the room because the hotel had apparently upgraded our room I must admit this was not something of which we were aware of until this point and we had not requested an upgrade The logic was that the hotel had a duty only to provide a room at the level booked and if they upgraded then they could reduce the grade thereafter at their discretion The upgrade appeared to solely relate to a king size bed in the room The \\\\x93king size\\\\x94 bed was actually 2 single beds pushed together Expedia advised that all they could do was to request that a case manager open a file and that they would be in touch This did not happen and I had to call them several times and spend several hours on hold whilst it went to 6 different Expediaites I also mentioned that I felt a full refund would be appropriate to Expedia We had to forego dinner that evening whilst dealing with this nonsense because it was too late to go out after these calls Not exactly the stress reducing and restful evening that we had planned and wanted after a whole day traveling The next day we left for the hospital at 6 55 am and whilst my wife was in a medical appointment at about 9 a m I received a call from the manager advising that we would not have our belongings packed up and moved and she would allow us to stay in the room Due to the threats against our belongings my wife had not felt comfortable enough to unpack The medical situation was stressful enough without this behaviour by the hotel and made my wife unable to relax and she slept only fitfully in spite of being exhausted The manager also advised me during this call at approximately 9 a m that she had faxed a letter to Expedia prior to our stay advising you to tell us that we would be moved This has not be proven to be true to this date and several managers have continually lied to Expedia representatives in the past 6 weeks This attitude alone and the extra stress and upset for my wife would have been bad enough by itself yet this hotel's facilities are also a disgrace\"]\n",

and if you are considering booking one of these rooms I advise against it The upgraded King Premier room was essentially the same as the Deluxe room except the bathroom was somewhat larger (although still small it was acceptable) and had a bath tub with jacuzi jets I was concerned about the possibility of hearing street noise from this lower floor room - and with the hotel staffer's assurancethat it wouldn't be a problem I decided on the upgraded room MY ROOM: Here's the good the bad and the ugly about my upgraded King Premier Room:The Good:* 42&quot Flat Screen TV (sweet ) plus DVD/CD player with surround-sound system * Very clean* Nicely furnished * Comfortable bed and pillows * Lots of mirrors * Candella nightlights were unique and created a nice atmosphere in the room * Plush terrycloth bathrobe * Bathtub with standard size tub with jacuzi jets was a nice bonus (but compare with better deep soaking tub at Hotel Monaco in Washington D C ) * Curved shower rod similar to Westin * The Thymes Limited bath amenities * Speaking of The Thymes I liked that instead of a mint on the pillow with turn down service they left a packet of The Thymes &quot Sleep Well&quot lotion on the pillow Nice touch The Bad:* Street noise was a problem on the 4th floor Despite earlier assurances by a hotel staffer street noise was a problem in the morning with the near constant honking of taxi horns waking me up For context I live in downtown Seattle and I am used to city noise But this level of noise was unacceptable * No power strip near desk Come on you've got a 42&quot flat screen TV --but no power strip near the desk for my laptop This should be standard and it was unacceptable to not have a power strip near the desk * The sliding door for the bathroom was very hard to move The door kept getting stuck and I couldn't get out of the bathroom without great effort * I didn't like the brown wood panel on the walls of my room in 70 Park Avenue Hotel Compared with other botique hotels I've stayed at the room wasn't as nice Sorry but the wood panel looked rather ugly and reminded me of the walls of the finished basement in my parents' 1970's-built house * Directly outside my room there was a linen cart during the entire duration of my stay I asked the front desk to move the cart and they said that it was a normal for 70 Park Avenue Hotel to store linen carts in the middle of hallways due to lack of space - but that they would move the linen cart elsewhere The cart was never moved A distinctive hotel should store linens in a closet and not outside my room in a linen cart I don't want to walk by a linen cart every time I leave my room and return The Ugly:* No high speed internet for you 70 Park Avenue features WiFi high speed Internet access throughout the hotel That's great in theory but my laptop doesn't connect to WiFi Upon my request the hotel sent up a bridge router but I was never able to connect to high speed Internet even with the bridge router I called Kimpton's toll free tech support number and tech support said the problem wasn't with my laptop but with something local at the hotel -- and amazingly they said they were &quot too busy to work on it&quot (and that's a direct quote) For context at the next botique hotel I stayed at I had no problems connecting via their regular direct line for high speed Internet In summary: high speed Internet is important to me - and I just want it to work at 70 Park Avenue Hotel it was not only a waste of my time and a headache customer service was unacceptable SPECIAL AMENITIES: 70 Park Avenue Hotel like all the Kimpton properties has an evening wine hour during which guests can socialize with each other I really like this concept HOTEL STAFF AND MANAGEMENT: The hotel manager I chatted with in the lobby was very friendly and professional The staff in front of the lobby elevator was friendly and helpful The people I spoke with gave 70 Park Avenue Hotel a personal touch that is often lacking in New York City CHECK OUT: fast and efficient WHEN BOOKING YOUR ROOM: If you decide to stay at 70 Park Avenue avoid the Deluxe rooms so you don't get the impossibly tiny bathroom Also be sure to get a higher level room to avoid street noise in the morning THE VERDICT: While I liked the hotel employees I met I'm not a big fan of the rooms at 70 Park Avenue Hotel I expect I will not stay at 70 Park Avenue on my next trip to New York City I must confess I prefer the W Hotel Times Square despite its own shortcomings the Platinum level upgrades from Starwood are generally better rooms ##For people who want a lot of detail including commentary about certain Kimpton Inner Circle benefits at this hotel there's even more on my personal travel blog athttp://insider blogs com/travel/2005/01/review_70_park_ html\"]\n",

            "['ace_hotel_nyc ', 'May-18-2009 ', \" A potential game-changer in the NYC boutique hotel scene I have to start by saying that my initial experience with the Ace was unpleasant I was told earlier this week four days before arrival that the hotel was not ready and that I'd been rebooked -- to be fair at the same $99 rate -- at a much less cool hotel around the corner A bit of protest on my part as well as me pointing out that I'd booked my room almost as soon as the reservations lines opened in January resulted in a 180 and I was moved back to the Ace My impressions thus far have been about as solid as it gets for a hotel that's been open to the general public all of three days While they allowed &quot friends and family&quot to stay here during the soft opening over the past few months permit issues apparently prevented them from opening to the public until this week so you may consider this the first unbiased critique of the property The hotel's by no means finished -- not every room is done and the inevitably doomed-to-be-packed restaurant The Breslin (run by the same folks who own the still-white-hot-after-many-years gastropub The Spotted Pig in the Village) won't be open until sometime this summer but there's no gym or room service either and maid service is spotty My room wasn't cleaned until 6pm and they failed to refill the minibar (To be fair the hotel has &quot room service&quot -- at a $7 50 delivery charge -- from several nearby restaurants including Hill Country debatably the best BBQ in the city As a Texan however my BBQ standards are pretty high and I've found Hill Country overpriced and underwhelming on previous visits but I'm admittedly picky on that front )Back to the hotel the service barring my initial reservations faux pas (including being sent an e-mail by a manager clearly meant for another manager not me) has been exemplary The staff are eager to please and as they should be: the Ace is a gem Granted it's in an off-the-beaten-path location -- sandwiched between the Chelsea Flower District and Koreatown -- and probably better for ex-pats such as myself or people already famiiar with the city given its lack of tourist attractions in the area (besides of course the original Macy's and the Empire State Building) but it has a convenience factor that can't be beat: within walking distance of Penn Station (well at least if you pack light and don't mind hauling your bags a few blocks) accessible from both JFK and Newark Airports It's also a few blocks from the Herald Square subway station which has connections to the majority of the four main boroughs and a block from the 28th St N/R/W stop For east side connections the 6 train's not too far a walk over on Park Ave South The lobby is to put it mildly dramatic: gargantuan in scale with towering ceilings and comfy seating throughout It's far bigger than the Ace's Portland branch but I can imagine it being put to similar use once the hotel gets its legs with folks wiling away the day drinking Stumptown Coffee and reading the Times or one of the numerous books tucked into the hotel's lobby -- which apparently has remained largely untouched from its days of way back as the Breslin Hotel (Think lots of wood paneling and built-in bookcases intermixed with an eclectic assortment of furniture )Upon arrival I was upgraded from the $99 &quot Cheap Room&quot I'd booked to a &quotDeluxe King &quot Although some Deluxe Kings are blessed with Smeg refrigerators one of my favorite kitschy design items mine was alas not It does however come with a mini-suite layout including large leather loveseat and coffee table (Caveat: while large by NYC standards the room's smaller than average by non-NYC standards about 300 sq ft ) The bathroom's on the disappointingly small side and more disappointingly fitted with brass faucets and the like including shower-curtain rings (Didn't someone tell the decorators that brass has been out since the '80s )My room faces the interior courtyard -- good if you're noise sensitive as I am but bad if you want consistent cell phone service (To be fair this problem afflicts nearly every NYC hotel I've stayed in ) Request an odd-numbered room if you want a street view (and cell phone access) the area's pretty quiet at night but gets noisy weekdays during commuting hours and weekends as street dealers set up to sell their wares Free wi-fi throughout the hotel (a perk no longer available at my other favorite NYC boutique chain the Thompson set) is much appreciated and helps mitigate the phone issue since I can make Skype calls on my iPhone The decor is both eclectic and an upgrade from the creaky wood floors at the Ace Portland These actually have carpet -- black which I normally dislike but which works great here (and great for concealing the inevitable spills) -- along with a wonderfully comfy bed equipped with multiple down pillows down comforter and if that's still not enough to stay warm a Pendleton blanket (No idea yet whether the HVAC can adequate handle winter chill since it's mid-May as I write this ) My one issue would be the TVs C'mon guys: 42&quot is the new standard and you skimped a couple hundred bucks and went with 32&quot flat-panels for even the highest-end non-suites Odd considering the not-cheap Knoll furnishings including a marble Saarinen Tulip table in the hotel's temporary breakfast facility (open 7-11am with Stumptown Coffee and not-bad croissant) The Breslin Bar also newly opened is fantastic with the most unique spin on an old-fashioned I've seen to date: one made with reposado tequila and agave nectar While this may seem like blasphemy to those used to the bourbon variety it has a truly unique appeal (Granted for the time being it's being served in plastic cups and I do hope they get some proper barware in the near future )I know this hotel has upset some folks by opening 3+ months late and by the fact that the $99 cheap rate no longer seems to be available (at least not for any dates I checked - I'm not counting bunk-bed rooms here since I refuse as an adult to sleep in one) but at the very least let it get past its teething pains finish all the rooms open The Breslin and give it a chance come maybe September or so I've stayed in most of the city's boutique hotels at this point and thus far the Ace has impressed me nearly the most -- if only because it's avoided formulaic luxury in favor of individualism In fact the only hotel I've stayed in here that comes close is the storied Chelsea Hotel -- but that's a whole other story entirely given its history (and the fact that most of its occupants are permanent)\"]\n",

from JFK to the hotel which is on the corner of 50th and 3rd on the east side in the midtown/upper east side area WARNING- there is currently some work being done to the outside of the building by contractors due to city requirements so there may be building noise between the hours of 0900-1700 But I dont know how long this will go on for Unfortunately this also meant that the terrace was out of bounds due to the structure of the contractors equipment STAFFThe staff were all very helpful and attentive They were great when we explained it was our anniversary and the manager left us a lovely card champagne and nibbles in our room for our arrival The maid happily made up the sofa bed one evening when we thought our niece may come and stay in the room and there would've been plenty of room for this to sleep 4 people The bed quickly folded away when not in use The doorman will help you whenever you need it getting cabs/your bags/directions etc and there is a full concierge service on the second floor during the day He can help you book tickets for theatre sightseeing etc and also helped us find things online we wanted to see without having to purchase the internet facility We also found that all the staff were happy to help us locate restaurants stores sight seeing etc ROOMWe got a great rate and then talked directly to the hotel about an upgrade which we got for only $30 more a night so ended up with the top suite available (1bed deluxe suite 700sqft) for a really great price We were on the 21st floor so the street noise didnt really bother us The corner suite (room 2103) was massive with:fully controllable air con/heating in both main rooms a huge super comfortable bed a kitchen with toaster fridge/freezerovendishwasher and all pots pans etc for 4 peopledining area with table/seat for four bathroom with bath/shower hairdryer and lit vanity mirror (plenty of high pressure hot water)iron/board two tv's with lots of channels/movies/sports etc radio/cd alarm programmable safe full mini bar with drinks/snacksand tons of windows and views over 3rd Avenue all the way uptown and downtown and down over 50th street and out over the Hudson River where we could see the tip of Roosevelt Island We did have a terrace but this was out of bounds during the stay I have to say it was one of the nicest beds I've slept in and the choice of pillows is great The room doesnt have a coffee machine but this is because the hotel's club room on the second floor has a pod coffee machine which is there all day (till 10pm I think) and so you can go and help yourself to drinks with disposable coffee cups/lids etc If you're a coffee drinker this alone would save you a fortune in starbucks My husband used the fitness centre which is very well equipped with free weights machines and mats etc as well as its own private bathroom towels tvs water etc The rooms decor was nice and although not brand new it was only showing some very slight signs of age It was very clean and comfortable and the lighting was very flexible to your requirements The seating area had a large sofa bed as well as two armchairs and 2 ottoman type seats There is also a full desk area with operator chair laptop connections and telephone etc The bedroom also had an armchair chest of drawers wardrobe space and an ottoman as well as bedside chests LOCATIONThe location is good and is close enough to Times Sq etc to walk to in say 30mins but not too close to be over the top busy/pricey etc Its literally one block from the Waldorf Astoria and a couple of blocks from Saks and 5th Avenue Rockafella Centre etc etc in quite a good area of the city There is a subway station at the opposite end of the block (51st station on the 6 line) and from there you are only a couple of stops from Union Sq which connects you to all the major lines We walked around a lot very late into the evening (1am) and the area felt safe as there was still a lot of tourists/cabs etc still on the streets EATINGWe walked east on 50th street to 2nd Avenue and this area has a couple of grocery stores and lots of restaurants which get quite busy with the corporate crowd We ate at a restuarant called Zarelas which is authentic mexican cuisine and was a lovely meal and is a really cosy eclectic atmosphere We also had frozen margaritas here We also ate at a really really nice Pizza restaurant called Angelos at 55th and 2nd which was very busy and great authentic thin base pizza and pizza pie for a good price(considering the portions ) We then stopped off at Crumbs Bakery (nice cupcakes)on the way back to the hotel On the corner of Lex and 50th there is a hotel called the Benjamin with a really nice bar/eatery called the Emery and we had a great cocktail and burger/steak there for a really good price There is a large deli type store on the next corner to the hotel (corner of 52nd/3rd) and also a Macdonalds Pax wholefood deli Bagel restaurant Mexian place Japanese BBQ new york diner and Indian which you can see from the hotel as well as Smith and Wollensky's Steakhouse but we didnt really use any of these We didnt use the hotels breakfast buffet as it seemed expensive at $14 each We went and bought juice and bagels instead and ate in our room I cant think of much else you would like to know about the hotel but if you want to ask questions I'm happy to try to assist We would definitely go back to this hotel (indeed we did for one final night after a beach holiday during the same trip and they gave us another good rate) and would recommend the hotel and the area in which it is located I think it would suit families very well as well as couples/business\"]\n",

it's a little noisy but when it's so cold you need it We just made sure to put it off before trying to sleep so that it wouldn't bother us There's no heating in the bathroom so in winter I can imagine it would be quite cold but for April it was ok The kitchen had your expected dishes available such as: glasses mugs plates and bowls There's no kettle for making boiling water for tea or coffee but they do have a coffee machine you can use that you are not charged for We ended up just buying some coffee and milk from the market along the road and we boiled water in a pot on the oven hob just because we like our own coffee Their coffee was all right too though Be careful if you are using their pot to cook anything because the metal handle will get very hot Our towels in the bathroom were changed daily and so were the beds that or at least they were made and always looked fresh and clean We had the do not disturb sign up one morning when the maids were cleaning the rooms on our floor since we had a late night and wanted a lie in and when we eventually did go out removing the sign they did come back and clean it later which is always good as some places would just have left it for that day since the room wasn't accessible at the cleaning time As you'd expect there is the odd wear and tear of the room marks on the walls or tables slightly faded carpets but nothing major I used the hairdyer from the bathroom and it worked quite well so no need to bring one with you if you usually do There was an iron in the cupboard aswell but we didn't need to iron anything so can't comment on how good it is The room safe is free you just select a 4-digit code to lock it when you first arrive and then use it to unlock it I picked the code when we arrived and the person who was with me made a mistake with it on the first night so we couldn't access it We told the staff the next morning when we were down at the desk and they had someone up very quickly who sorted it for us I noticed some people mentioned they got free fruit juice or something from the main lobby and desk on arrival to the hotel but we saw none of this on our stay so either we managed to by pass it somehow or they just didn't offer any to us I don't know Just thought I'd mention that as we did expect it from reviews we read and we didn't get anything I definitely recommend getting the subway around the city to the areas you can't walk to for example: downtown to Brooklyn Bridge Ground Zero or Battery Park for the ferries around the island and to the Statue of Liberty A few minutes walk around the corner from the left of the hotel when you leave it takes you to the 33rd street subway and you can buy a card easily at one of the machines for $7 to give you 4 rides on any route on the subway We used this to go downtown to the places I just mentioned Also would be usefull if you want to go uptown to Central Park We could easily walk to the other main attractions: Empire State Building Rockefeller Centre Times Square and shops We decided to go up to the Empire State Building observation during the day then another day we went up the Rockefeller Top of The Rock obsevation at night for a different view of the city which was lovely If you were planning on doing only one of them then you might like to try what we did If you want to get tickets to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island I recommend you be at Battery Park for early in the morning like around 8am Wrap up for the cold aswell We arrived too late to Battery Park to get to go to the Statue of Liberty which was a bit disappointing Also if you are arriving at Newark airport for the hotel thanks to another reviewer here we managed to figure out that we could easily get a train from Newark Penn Station (that you can get to easily from the free Newark airport airtrain) to New York Penn Station on 33rd street for $15 each way This is about a 15 minute walk to the hotel but as you have luggage a cab is probably the easiest once you arrive at the station Transferring between here is really the only time it's ever worth getting a cab as streets are 1-way and there are so many crossings that means the cab journey is longer and more expensive than walking or getting a subway most of the time It cost us $10 each way roughly Overall our stay at the Affinia Dumont was pretty good Apart from arriving leaving and our mistake with the safe code we didn't speak to staff much so can't really say if they were that helpful and friendly and we didn't see the spa or fitness centre of the hotel to comment on those I'd recommend staying here if you get a good deal on the rooms and you want to stay somewhere comfortable and that is accessible to the popular New York attractions\"]\n",

sightseeing the location was fine In any case getting a cab was very easy and cheap and the concierge was always on hand to hail a cabNearby there is a very good selection of local shops and mini markets selling everything you could possibly need Just across the road and down a little is a Duane Reade pharmacy If I had to complain it would be about two things The first was the mini bar I really dislike a mini bar especially in a hotel where the items can be purchased much cheaper locally But I mostly dislike them because I am invariably charged on my final bill for items I have not taken from the bar This time $16 was added to my bill for mini bar OK so it won\\\\x92t bankrupt me but that\\\\x92s not the point When I told the receptionist that I did not take anything from the mini bar she politely told me that she would remove the charge This did not alleviate my embarrassment however I would have preferred the incorrect charge not be there in the first place I believe hotels should give guests the option of having/not having a mini bar This would be a very simple thing for housekeeping to organise The second issue I had was with the housekeeping lady who repeatedly told us that we were not displaying our \\\\x91do not disturb\\\\x92 sign correctly She insisted on day one that we always display the sign outside our door I thought that this was rude and also unnecessary I have not come across this previously in other decent hotels Also on the last day when we were just getting ready to vacate our room at 11am (checkout is 12pm) she knocked on our door and asked us what time we were leaving at The reason our sign was not displayed correctly is that the darn thing kept falling off the door handle as it wasn\\\\x92t a very well designed sign If the Affinia Dumont place such emphasis on their \\\\x91do not disturb/make me up\\\\x92 signs then they should have better signs or at least signs that don\\\\x92t blow off the handle with every puff of air I have been in a hotel where there is an electrical switch used for this purpose It still bugs me that I left her a decent tip Overall though I would definitely recommend the Affinia Dumont we had a great time there and the few little annoyances were outweighed by a very pleasant stay I do think the majority of staff there goes the extra mile to ensure the guests enjoy their stay']\n",

female 5'3&quot 110 lbs - I couldn't stand in the shower without touching a wall I felt dirtier after getting out The shower curtain didn't reach the floor so I flooded the bathroom everytime The sink was stained The hairdryer was caked with dust and smelled of burnt hair The hotel is next to Madison Square Gardens There was a concert on our first night there Being in the end unit it was loud My friends were 2 doors up and heard nothing though There were roll up blinds on the windows I went to close them and discovered they were covered with grimy fingerprints It was so gross The one wouldn't even close so I just strategically avoided walking in front of it while dressing lol I managed to miss closing one in the kitchen and at first glance actually thought there were people in my room The apartment building next door was that close I seriously could've reached out the window and touched the other building Btw I realized all of this as I was walking out of the shower Every night after about 6pm you had to show your room key in order to enter the elevators A bit of a pain Not sure why there was such strict security Our flight out wasn't until late in the evening so we had to store our bags at the hotel after checking out The desk clerk rang for the bellhop to take our bags to storage and then walked away there were no other staff to be seen We waited for 15 min before anyone came out and it wasn't a bellhop It was the first friendly and helpful staff member we'd seen in 3 days a very pregnant woman who attempted to call for a bellhop 2 more times before she started to take our bags herself Of course we wouldn't let her and took the bags ourselves and followed her to the room Just then a bellhop arrived conveniently Considering the security measures to get on the elevator you'd think they'd have something in place for bags The room was completely full of luggage and there was no reference # given to us or anything Somehow we did manage to get all of our bags when we checked out but again I dragged my suitcase noisily down the stairs because there was no one there to assist\"]\n",

6 selections and a free kit to use while you are there which were a yoga kit a wine tasting kit or a walking tour kit which came with headphones an IPod and a set of cards with touring walks I chose that one but in the end we didn't use it You do want to keep the kit safe as they will charge you of course if anything happens to the IPod The location is great We took the train from Philadelphia to Penn Station and walked across the street and we were there at the hotel The hotel is one of the nice old fashioned-looking buildings on the outside but a modern lobby that is sort of pointless actually I guess if you are meeting someone and need a place to sit somewhere it's ok but somehow it feels like they haven't exactly finished it The staff were all very very nice and accomodating The concierges were great Our first room was on the 20th floor and our terrace looked out across a u-shaped space to the rooms terraceless opposite us as well as both side streets and a variety of fascinating apartments and one building next door that was having the brick removed by workmen that was fascinating to watch but there was no 'romantic' view When I called the desk to see if there was another room with a 'New York' view they said they could move us on Friday to a higher floor and we were happy The room had a HUGE bed and the room appointments were very classy black brown silver and gold colors on the bed furnishings It had a kitchen with a small under counter fridge a microwave dishes silverware all the trappings which came in handy as our first meal in NYC was right after we'd come down from the Empire State Building watching a huge rainstorm eat upper Manhattan We ducked into The Main Noodle House at 1011 6th Avenue feeling very Newyawkish The menu was huge they had a delivery boy on a bike who came and went and tons of people coming in for take out We got two dishes one of which was beef and green bean and ginger which was fabulous Both dishes were better than most Chinese food I've had and we took the left overs with us as we had the means to reheat and re-eat in our room Friday we moved up to the 24th floor and there from our shared terace this time was the Empire State Building in all her lit up glory and from the bedroom window you could see the Chrysler Building between a couple other tall buildings if you stood just right Now this room was a completely different configuration It had a hallway from the main room past the kitchen which this time had a FULL sized refrigerator around a corner to the terrace door and a large closet with a mirrored front The terrace was shared with a room down a lonely hall but which had a window from the hall that opened onto our balcony There was a large iron fence with the middle blocked out so you wouldn't see your neighbors exactly In the end I preferred room 2014 the first room over room 2414 view of the Empire State notwithstanding Plus it poured Friday night so we were only able to enjoy the sight for a bit on Saturday night Other than sirens there was no noise we noticed The toiletries were LOVELY The bathrooms in the two rooms were also completely different 2014 having the nicer larger area but neither was large by any standard They were clean and bright We were able through the concierge desk to get tickets to see God of Carnage which won 3 Tonys on our anniversary - very expensive tickets through a broker but the Tonys were 3 days away and we had right end 2nd row mezzanine seats which were better than the box seats in front of us and I'm truly sorry I can't remember the name of the woman who helped us the most My husband noticed she and I had the same glasses She was wonderful and very patient with us We also wanted to eat at Patsy's Italian restaurant at 236 W 56th St which was Frank Sinatra's apparent favorite place to eat Italian in NY or so we were told Teensy bar two floors packed with diners lots of famous photos on the downstairs walls and fabulous food This was our anniversary dinner and they gave us a gift bag with a jar of spaghetti sauce to take home We took the Metro everywhere Pretty easy to use self-ticket machines and very well marked routes Funny thing is they go up and down the island but to get across you take the bus or you go from Times Square across to Grand Central Station by subway where there is NO PLACE TO SIT in the main terminal You wanna sit You go down to the food court where they have lots of nice places to eat and drink and hilariously large PeeWee's Playhouse type overstuffed plastic chairs to sit in Never having been to NYC before we tried to fit in as much tourist stuff as possible Empire State Ellis Island we were too late to get tickets for entry to Lady Liberty so we passed up getting off there If you are interested at all in how America got it's Eastern European population Ellis Island would take up most of your day anyway The headphpnes are a must to tour the main building The museum also is very well done but we didn't have enough time It would have taken all day and we couldn't do that The boat ride is fun too The upstairs bow area gets quite crowded and there's no where to sit If you want to sit at all get in line early The tickets are available in the fort at Battery Park I'm sure there must be other places to get them but we weren't very well prepared with information on this trip and we slept in because the bed was so comfy Walked by the World Trade Center site but couldn't find the memorial The area is blocked by fences and machinery The little church facing the site has a wonderful memorial in it We also went to the Museum of Natural History on a very rainy Friday Lesson do not go first thing in the morning If it is a week day and a school day all the kids in Manhattan are probably on school tours You can see plenty if you wait till after lunch The school kids are gone by about 2 The self check in at the museum is great except we thought we were getting tickets to see the planetarium and while we got to pick 3 add-ons to the initial entry the planetarium was NOT one of those items In the end after wandering around in utter confusion the info desk IN the planetarium actually comped us tickets to the planetarium show We were very pleased and amazed by the overall helpfulness and courtesy of EVERYone we encountered in NYC Must do if you are tired of walking take the sing it with me now THE THREE HOUR TOUR from Circle Line tours that goes entirely around the island The tours are not from the Ellis Island/Liberty Island dock Don't make that mistake Ask your conceirge - again- and they usually can print timed tickets for you for the tours at no additional cost Then when you are done cross the street and go to Celebrity Bowling and have a Guiness on tap some really unusual bowling alley food that can almost be calld 'gourmet' and watch the movies or glow bowling or whatever is going on We had a martini at the roof garden of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and also ate dinner there which was very good and it was wonderul looking into the museum's first floor area and out the big window into Central Park Also do NOT miss the Frick Gallery if you like art close up Two Vermeer's RIGHT there you can see the brush strokes Give your self more than 1-1/2 hours though We went after the Mus Nat History on that rainy Friday All in all we were very pleased with the whole experience and oh those beds at the Affinia I would definitely stay there again\"]\n",

hotel Ignore the moaners that have posted reviews this is a very good hotel for the price and the service was brilliant Prior to booking a hotel in NY I did extensive research on the best customer rated hotels in my price range and the Affina impressed me for three main reasons firstly the location and secondly the fact the management regularly respond to negative reviews (so are clearly keen to listen to feedback) and thirdly the fact it has recently been renovated (very nicely too ) Having lived in NY for 4 months several years ago I was very confident that the location of the Affina would tick all the boxes for getting to the tourist sites and shops There is no \\\\x91perfect\\\\x92 location in New York if you want to explore the whole city inevitably wherever you stay some places will entail a bit of a treck to get to However the Affina is great for a walk to all mid-town areas (Empire State Times Square 5th Avenue shops Central Station UN Building etc) and is only a very short walk away to the 6 train (either at Grand Central or on 33rd Street) and is slightly longer 20 min brisk walk to the 123 trains (at Penn Station) so it was easy to get everywhere The neighbourhood is very safe \\\\x96 we walked back from the subway after 2am on some nights and it was quiet and didn\\\\x92t feel threatened at all There are several bars in the area a 5 min walk away I would highly recommend the rooftop bar on the hotel it is only open when its not raining but is very plush and has a great atmosphere and great service\\\\x85 Not to mention views which are spectacular The bar off the lobby \\\\x96 RARE \\\\x96 is excellent as well Top class service from the bar and waiting staff and it has a really good atmosphere We found it a great way to start and end a night out The food there is great and very reasonably priced (classic burger for nine dollars ) The breakfast there is also very reasonably priced (ten dollars for coffee juice toast and a full cooked breakfast ) The hotel itself is of a very high standard \\\\x96 the lobby area is very comfortable and stylish and very clean We were very impressed with the size of our room Having stayed in New York Hotels previously and many in London city hotel rooms are generally very small\\\\x85 We only had a standard room but it was massive The beds were I think queen size and the bed linen (and much commented upon pillows\\\\x85 ) were very comfortable and in fact I would go as far to say the best bed I have ever had from a hotel We also had a microwave and fridge in our room which were a nice touch but we didn\\\\x92t use them The air con was a god send in 90 degree heat and having been shown how to switch it off (found it silent at night\\\\x85 just use the control panel on the actual metal unit on the left hand side to set the fan speed and switch off completely) and the thermostat on the wall controls the temperature The bathroom was ample size and very very clean (I\\\\x92m quite fussy over bathrooms and this had nothing to complain about) My only slight moan would be that the bath towels could have been bigger but they did leave you 4 of them so more than made up for size in quantity The elevator is slow at times but that\\\\x92s only because at 9am in the morning you get a lot of people checking out filling the lift with cases and it takes a while\\\\x85 If you can\\\\x92t handle a five minute wait \\\\x96 you are missing out on a great hotel We found it quite nice the way guests would talk in the elevator or whilst waiting for it rather a nice touch personally As for noise \\\\x96 we genuinely didn\\\\x92t hear anything that caused us any alarm Indeed on some nights we commented it was so quiet we couldn\\\\x92t believe we were in a city We were on the back of the hotel into the atrium so no road noise There was some slight music noise form the upstairs bar but as we were not in bed at 8pm didn\\\\x92t bother us\\\\x85 If you were looking for an early night on a Friday night there could possibly be some noise you may want to consider By way of accommodation \\\\x96 I could not fault the hotel We got excellent rates on Expedia and I would recommend the Affina to any friends/colleagues coming to New York providing it keeps getting good reviews I would definitely return next year The service we received from the hotel staff was also of a high standard I can\\\\x92t fault anyone Door staff were excellent the member of staff who carried our bags to the room gave us a tour of the facilities and how to operate the air con (including how to turn it off) how to use the TV fridge ice box lights lamps and microwave\\\\x85 This saved us so much time The cleaner was never seen or heard but did a great job \\\\x96 every morning when we got back from breakfast our room was made fresh The reception and concierge were all helpful with our queries Maintenance in particular were very helpful \\\\x96 when we arrived I had a problem with my hair straighteners (voltage issues\\\\x85 nothing to do with the hotel) and I wanted to borrow an adapter\\\\x85 Reception didn\\\\x92t have any but sent someone up from maintenance to see if they could help after playing around with them he went to get an adapter for me\\\\x85 Although it still didn\\\\x92t work it was just excellent service helping me with something that wasn\\\\x92t even the hotel\\\\x92s problem In the end it couldn\\\\x92t be fixed so they directed me to the nearest shop to buy some (on a Sunday evening) We also had maintenance change lamps in the room which we hadn\\\\x92t even reported as broken because the cleaning staff had noticed a bulb out\\\\x85 My only suggestions about how the hotel could be improved are to make Wi-Fi free (or at least have pc's in the lobby with free acess to the internet I only wanted to quickly check emails or facebook and it was thirteen dollars a day or sixty nine for the week way too much Also tea or coffee making facilities in the room would have been most welcome Whilst im sure if we had asked they would have provided them it would have been nice to be able to make a cuppa in the morning All in all \\\\x96 whilst we didn\\\\x92t spend that much time in our room as we were out exploring whilst in New York on a tiring week if your hotel is awful it really can ruin your entire trip \\\\x96 so I am very pleased that all the research I put in to find a great hotel paid off and we had an excellent stay\\\\x85 My summary is that it is an excellent value hotel great rooms and facilities and helpful staff P S \\\\x96 I can highly recommend Rossini\\\\x92s restaurant on 38th Street between Lexington and Park\\\\x85 It is very old school new york with a pianist most nights and only 2 min

close to shopping restaurants etc Concierge April and door man Dennis were great as well Room size was good RARE grill expensive and not the cleanest Front Desk and service - ok Elevators - small and very slow Remodel - tried to look expensive quality of the renovation work was not good at all We arrived at the hotel and check in was good since it was early part of the day I asked if our room was ready at front desk since it was before checkin in time and she said yes I also asked if some preferences that I included in my reservation and asked if those were able to be accomodated She advised yes and proceeded to give us our room key etc Note: I did confirm that all rooms had showers AND a bathtub before booking my reservation and the answer was YES We proceeded to the room with the bell man and baggage (elevator very small and slow) and the room she gave us was a walk in shower with a shower curtain - one of my requests was a glass shower with a tub So we went back to the front desk and queried again and now I was told that some rooms have showers and tubs with the shower curtain others just have the glass shower or walk in shower So I told them that I would like a tub please so she gave us the key to another room We said we will check it out before dragging our luggage to another room and be unsatisfied Checked it out and there was a shower and tub alright with a GREAT BIG BLACK MOLD LINE were the grout/caulking finishes for the tile and where the tub begins - GROSS So needless to say we didn't take that room and since there was no one from fron desk accompanying us we couldn't show them but we told them So now we are on to our 3rd room This room had the similiar issue with the tub but not as bad a rust ring around the tub faucet hair on the shower curtain liner and in the tub and dirt on the mirror We complained again and housekeeping came and changed the shower liner (which they apologized for) and noted the black grout/mold would have to be cleaned while we were out because of the kind of chemical they were going to use Housekeeping also advised that it all may not come out becaue that is the kind of grout/caulking that was used OK by this time we are tired and irritated So we just settled in this room (which was room #1501 on the 15th floor) which was by the elevator where I specifically requested NOT TO BE Well throughout the night a fly was buzzing around my ears - yes a fly Ok - cool killed it and went back sleep - ANOTHER one came on buzzing I woke my husband up cos it took me a while to catch that one - had the lighgts on and everything Finally killed that one - this one was a mosquito looking one and the other was a fruit fly type The next day we told front desk about it and they said they'll have it checked While we were getting ready to go out we killed about another 4 yes 4 and left one visible so they can see it We let them know we left the dead one for them to see and we went to breakfast in the RARE grill where would you believe the SAME FLIES were there No kidding When we got back to the room housekeeping had been there but there was not note stating they checked the fly issue While we dropping our shopping bags off there was another fruit fly The bed was made trashed wasn't emptied and mirror still dirty We went back out and on our way out we stopped to the front desk to ask if the issue had been looked into She wasn't sure as she just came in She offered us to have maintenence come and have a look when we get back and another room but the hotel was totally booked and we could have the room the next night but we were already irritated We knew the next room could be worse - I guess the saying you know what you've got but you don't know what you're going to get was applied When we arrived back to the room maintenence came and sprayed some sort of spray - it had VERY VERY MINIMAL ODOR After it was about 2 or 3 for the rest of our stay I was sooooo glad to be leaving that hotel at the end of our stay During checkout we asked could they discount us for the inconvenience of the fly issue and front desk said all they can do is discount our movie which was already discounted because when we went to play it all these lines were showing up you couldn't see the movie and it was frozen The room service lunch they couldn't discount ($49) beacuse the restaurant is not theirs and they couldn't adjust the room rate because of how it was in the computer So we were offered compliementary breakfast in the RARE grill I really wasn't feeling that at all but we took it I was confused - you could offer complimentary breakfast to the RARE grill though it's not your restaurant but you can't take off the lunch and pay for it out of the hote's pocket Anyway at at the grill for breakfast again since I didn't have to pay for it and the flies were still there I thank the hotel for trying to make us comfortable but I was very disappointed and not impressed with this hotel I will not return and I will not recommend this hotel to anyone BTW -

block and down were there were a lot less people so it didn't take half as long if you were doing it on the main drag Being next door to Grand Central Station had its perks for us to though because if was raining really bad you could get to anywere in the city even just a couple of blocks up you could get the tube for $2 which is amazing value for money If it is raining it is great as you just come out of the station and you can run right into your hotel When staying at The Grand Hyatt you find the areas around very interesting to the sides you are surrounded by huge offices and on the main road you are about 5 minutes away from a local market and the famous library featured on Ghostbusters The hotel looks out on to a main road which has some pretty spectacular views as you can see all the yellow taxis going up and down and its just like a picture you expect to see FIRST IMPRESSIONSFrom the outside you can see the hotel from the top of the street it looks really tall and looks like it is all made from glass as it shines very brightly and is very noticeable as you can see the large Hyatt sign about 2 miles away When you walk through the large revolving doors you are met with a large open carpeted space and an escalator up to the reception area Once you are in the reception area you are met with a large reception desk to your left were you check in a bar on the next level next to the reception and a huge open seated area were anyone can sit and believe me anyone does I sat waiting for my transfer home and some Americans were having a book club meeting The reception area was big but it didn't have the wow factor for me sure it had large pots of flowers and a huge fountain but the atmosphere to me resembled that in a shopping arcade it had no natural light and was very much for show On the right hand side of the room there was a huge Piano with table and chairs which I think were for special occasions but sitting in a reception area to me is not very special Straight ahead are about 6 lifts to take you to your room These were a little more sophisticated with a large mirror behind you and a monitor with an image of concierge on talking you through all the floors The lifts had a red carpet and golden features very plush CHECKING INThis is a very painful experience to say the least when they are busy As we travelled at Christmas time I suppose it was a lot more congested but the staff just weren't up to the volume of customers When we arrived there was a lot of argy bargy going on with some Americans who did not have the right room bookedPictures of Grand Hyatt New York New York City reception and were arguing with the staff and amongst themselves you then had others trying to push to the front and people who were just wondering around like they didn't have a care in the world We as British people must have looked liked headless chickens because we did not have a clue what to do there was no help and if you stood around too close to the stairs the staff got annoyed and told us to move not very pleasant Once we arrived at check in we were told we had 3 rooms between 8 of us which was fine but they were all doubles no three bedded rooms You tell me how 8 people fit in 3 beds it just wasn't going to happen However we couldn't be too annoyed as there were people being told they had been overbooked and they didn't actually have a room after all on the 29th December to say tempers were frayed was an understatement Once we had checked in I was not in the mood for letting one of the bell boys take my case for $5 not that mattered because we were not even asked they were too busy running around fussing over everybody else So we hauled our cases into the lift and headed for the 18th floor Once we arrived in our rooms a concierge dumped a fold away bed in our rooms with no bedding or even an apology This made my aunty who booked the holiday very angry so they went to complain and we were told two proper beds would be brought in and we could all have breakfast for the 5 nights we were staying and considering there were 8 of us and it was $25 a head we were quite glad Needless to say they did bring another put me up bed which was exactly the same as hard as nails and about 20cm from the ground We were quick to realise the hotel was full to the rafters and we were not going to get better beds until some of the other guests shipped out so we didn't bother mentioning it again THE ROOMSThese were nice enough they were of a good standard quite large at 250sq ft but only what I would consider a business class room by this I mean a standard hotel you would stay in on business had gone enough facilities was clean and had modern d\\xe9cor It wasn't the sort of room I would call luxurious but what did I expect for the money I was paying That's the problem I didn't know what to expect and I suppose I got what is average in most US hotels clean modern and just a place to lay your head The rooms were quite large with a 3 door wardrobe large desk with draw storage and a free computerised safe You then have your standard 25inch TV iron and ironing board radio/alarm clock hairdryer telephone and complimentary toiletries In each room you can either have one king sized bed or two double beds in all rooms we had the standard king sized beds Each rooms has its own heat controller so you can have the air conditioning on when you want and the heating on whenever you want Well that was the idea but you had to put it on at least an hour before you were going to get cold because it took that long to warm up but at least if you were too hot it took about 2 seconds to return to an ice box I am a bit fussy when it comes to heat I love a nice warm room and this just wasn't it The room had two large windows that opened which was nice if you wanted a quick blast of cold air but really something I didn't understand as air conditioning doesn't work when you have windows open and on the 18th floor you didn't have much to see unless you wanted to peer right into someone's office A nice feature was that all rooms got a copy of the New York Times free of charge ok we didn't ever read it but it was a nice touch The bathroom was a huge disappointment it was clean and had marble features a toilet sink and regularly changed towels but the shower was terrible it was just a shower head and a horrible shower curtain I think that sort of setup is far from 4* it is the sort of thing I expect in European 3* hotels but not American 4* hotels I would at least expect a decent shower or even shower over bath there was enough room for it but they just hadn't seemed to have bothered The temperature of the water was also very hard to get right it was either freezing cold or boiling hot On the first night we had to call the reception as the water was stone cold and we thought it wasn't going to heat up but after 20 minutes of being continuously on it finally heated up In all the Hyatt has 1311 rooms The rooms we stayed in were just the standard rooms which was the only choice given to us by Virgin but reading about the other rooms I don't think I would have bothered to pay any extra as none of the rooms seemed like they were any better they just had more seating areas The choices were junior suites which were 450 sq ft and had a dining table work area and parlour VIP suites which were 600sq ft and had the same areas as the junior suites but with a view of the street and a marble and granite bath and now the Lexington suites which are a bit in the middle of the junior suite and the VIP suite as the rooms are 350 sq ft and have the same areas as the other to do but the Lexington also has the views The only upgrade I would have considered and obviously never would have afforded was the Regency club it definitely has the WOW factor if you stayed in one of these rooms you would be on the restricted area known as the 31st floor This floor is only for the guests booked in as regency guest in the price you get a continental breakfast and evening meal in the exclusive private lounge known as Hors D'oeuvres The floor also has it is own personal concierge and amazing views of New York City THE D\\xc9CORIn and around the hotel everything is quite traditional to look modern chic like the marble floors cream carpets leather and upholstered chairs You then get your gold finishes and bright lighting to make up for the lack of natural light The rooms are mainly finished to a good standard which are lit with about 3 lamps to give an nice relaxed feel with the furniture being a dark brown wood and a nice white crisp bed with gold and brown accessories COMFORT FACTORIn each room you get a high bed with nice fluffy pillows and quilt which feel really nice and comfortable when you get in especially when you get in from a long day You also get a nice comfortable chair which doubles as a clothes rack every night if you are me and there is also a nice comfy twirly chair at the desk which is nice also for draping all your clothes over The seating areas in the reception were also comfortable a little worn feeling but comfortable having to share the lobby with a bunch of people who aren't even staying in the hotel is a bit weird but you get used to it WERE TO EATMost hotels in the US are based on a room only price and for anything they mess up they offer a free breakfast so most people end up getting a free breakfast So your ok there but when it comes to lunch and your evening meal it is really difficult to find somewere nice yet cheap as in my personal experience you cant get it The immediate area around the hotel is not the best place to eat but when it is raining you don't really have a choice opposite the hotel you have a burger bar type place from the outside and when you get in there it is very different with a very formal sit down dinner area and for 5 soups and 5 soft drinks you are looking at around $80 and that wasn't because we were feeling tight we just wanted some thing warm in our bellies if we had gone for the full courses we would have been looking at about the same per head There is a nice large Mc Donald's 5 minutes down the road if you fancy it cheap and cheerful The only place nearby that I found acceptable to eat was at Grand Central station n the lower floor they have a very large food mall with about 15 different food outlets selling all kinds foods that you could rake away or eat in the large seating area You can get a Chinese meal in there for around $10 with a drink and you will get to sample 3 different dishes If you prefer to eat in the hotel you can make a visit to theMANHATTAN SKY RESTAURANT BARThis really is a very informal restaurant overlooking the busy New York road and is well known for having the best breakfast menu on 42nd street and I can't disagree The restaurant is set out very nice with the main buffet area at the front were you walk in and then up a couple of steps a large area full of large tables and comfortable chairs next to 3 very large ceiling to floor windows so you get an amazing soundless view The restaurant is open for breakfast everyday from 6:30am till 11:30am I would advise to go really early or really late as the restaurant gets rammed after 8am When you arrive in the restaurant you will be seated by a waiter or waitress who will then get you any toast hot and cold drinks Now it is down to the buffet my favourite part once you have grabbed a plate the world is your oyster the food looks amazing and you always take far too much than you can eat The first area is the hot area were you can choose from bacon tomatoes eggs and black pudding and if you don't fancy any of that there is a chef on hand to cook you a fresh omelettes fried eggs and pancakes Next is the cold area which was a selection of cheeses and different hams I always avoid these areas because I hate ham and not much of a cheese person especially in the early morning Next to those you have a cereal area were you can pick any sort of cereal your heart desires even a bowl of hot porridge if you fancy it is all on hand The end part was my favourite part and was very much a weakness for me one table was covered in fresh fruit strawberries melon grapes oranges apples you name it they had it and I know your all thinking wow she is so healthy I couldn't help but feats my eyes over the next table filled with Danishes Oh my god they were good croissants apple Danishes orange Danishes muffins and blueberry buns They were gorgeous a girls dream and you could eat as much as you want The food was excellent and I suppose if you were paying $25 a head you would expect that but the service was really good the staff couldn't do enough for you and the view is really amazing Every other morning everyone would also get a small shot glass of a fruit smoothie which I thought was a nice touch didn't always taste great but a nice touch If you happened to be around the hotel at lunch time you could go back here and enjoy a selection of sandwiches and entrees unfortunately we never did this as we were out for most of the day and grabbed a bite in a subway or burger bar what ever was closest at the time However I think if the food at lunch was as good as at breakfast it would have been delicious The restaurant was open 11am till 2pm for lunch In the evening if you aren't out sampling New York's nightlife and too tired to drag yourself out you can make a reservation at THE COMMODORE GRILL This was a much more sophisticated atmosphere open 5pm till 11pm the commodore is a place you need to make a reservation at and this can be done at the hotel or online when we went it was Christmas time so we couldn't go and had to go to the Marriott in Times Square which was quite a bit more expensive but had a better view Once you have a table booked you can look forward to full waiter service and a wide American continental cuisine menu The restaurant is obviously upmarket and you can expect to get a meal there for around $30-$50 a head which isn't bad as you can't get a really good meal in an upmarket restaurant for that ROOM SERVICEIf you don't fancy leaving your room for a bite to eat or your thirsty in the night you can order from the room service menu which is ok if your desperate but is very expensive and not really worth shelling out for although a lot of people seemed to have as when they finished it sometimes took the staff a while to come and get the trolleys from outside the rooms You could choose a simple soup for about $8 a steak for $22 or a basic curry or lasagne for $16 a tea or coffee for $4 and the a %10 service charge and 12 5% room service charge on top It isn't bad as far as room service goes but if you were really that thirsty you could just nip to the end of the corridor and get a free glass of water from the water machine and a couple of ice cubes or you could feed the vending machine $2 and get a can of pop OTHER FACILITIESThe hotel is very big and has facilities for all different types of people on the first level you will find about 4 different gift shops selling over priced souvenirs and toiletries just in case of emergencies Which unfortunately I had to purchase I wasn't expecting a period and ended up paying \\xa36 for an average pack of always sanitary towels which can be purchased here in the UK for about \\xa31 49 I was disgusted but when you are desperate you have no choice The concierge theatre and tour desk which was open from about 9am till 5pm and was very helpful you could book any trips here and the staff were very helpful in helping you make decisions there was also a wide array of leaflets you could take to your room and make decisions over The Commodore Lounge which was open from 2pm till 1am and could be found opposite the Commodore Grill this is the best place to hang out in the hotel it is very comfortable and sophisticated You can get light snacks cocktails and a good selection of wines and beers that were priced reasonably ish after all you are on holiday but a beer usually sets you back about \\xa33 50 and a glass of wine anything from \\xa34 upwards Grand Caf\\xe9 barThis was a nice reasonable coffee bar which mainly opened and closed whenever it was busy because when ever we seemed to go there it was closed The coffee here was really nice and it is a very relaxed area despite being just above one of the busiest areas of the hotel For those who are interested here are the other facilities the hotel has that I did not take advantage of \\x95Valet Parking\\x95Business centre and conference facilities\\x95Internet access\\x95Large gymCHECKING OUTThankfully for us and a lot of other checking out was pretty painless ish We used a self check out machine which was very simple at the end of your stay you swipe your key card through the machine press on the names that are sharing that room and then confirm that there is no charges for room service or anything and you post your swipe card all done However we were not getting picked up until 19:30 that evening so we had to check our luggage into the luggage room This was pretty easy we just handed over our cases and were given a slip to collect our cases later there was no charge for this and they didn't even expect a tip Checking out was all well and good but it had to be done by 11:30am and there was no other option such as a day room or anything I know you are in the middle of New York and must be plenty of things to do but when you have spent all of your money and it is chucking it down with rain you don't really feel like wandering around so by about 16:00 we thought we would go back to the hotel have a sit down and a bit of a rest before out flight How wrong could we be the staff are so strict you can't get away with anything I was very tired and closed my eyes for about 5 minutes when I was told to get up and sleep with my eyes open I know I was in the middle of a hotel reception and am sure you guys are thinking what the hell was she doing but this reception was huge and more like a public area and was definitely not filled with a 4* standard snob I then took my shoes off so I could fold my legs I mean 4 hours is a long time but obviously this was a big no no and was told if I didn't put my shoes on right now I would have to wait outside That is hospitable OVERALLAfter a nice few days the treatment of staff really left a bad taste in my mouth I was a customer and had paid good money to stay in this hotel and they were going to throw me out To be honest given the choice I wouldn't stay here again I would go more up market and stay in a more luxurious hotel in a better location and that actually looked like a hotel and not a shopping arcade I would give this hotel about Staff 1/10 (except the maids they did a good job 9/10 for them)Facilities 4/10Rooms 6/10Food 8/10Value for money 2/10Location 7/10    0.678806\n",
            " Excellent Hotel Excellent Location Excellent Staff I have just returned from a week long stay at the Affina Murray Hill \\x96 an excellent hotel Ignore the moaners that have posted reviews this is a very good hotel for the price and the service was brilliant Prior to booking a hotel in NY I did extensive research on the best customer rated hotels in my price range and the Affina impressed me for three main reasons firstly the location and secondly the fact the management regularly respond to negative reviews (so are clearly keen to listen to feedback) and thirdly the fact it has recently been renovated (very nicely too ) Having lived in NY for 4 months several years ago I was very confident that the location of the Affina would tick all the boxes for getting to the tourist sites and shops There is no \\x91perfect\\x92 location in New York if you want to explore the whole city inevitably wherever you stay some places will entail a bit of a treck to get to However the Affina is great for a walk to all mid-town areas (Empire State Times Square 5th Avenue shops Central Station UN Building etc) and is only a very short walk away to the 6 train (either at Grand Central or on 33rd Street) and is slightly longer 20 min brisk walk to the 123 trains (at Penn Station) so it was easy to get everywhere The neighbourhood is very safe \\x96 we walked back from the subway after 2am on some nights and it was quiet and didn\\x92t feel threatened at all There are several bars in the area a 5 min walk away I would highly recommend the rooftop bar on the hotel it is only open when its not raining but is very plush and has a great atmosphere and great service\\x85 Not to mention views which are spectacular The bar off the lobby \\x96 RARE \\x96 is excellent as well Top class service from the bar and waiting staff and it has a really good atmosphere We found it a great way to start and end a night out The food there is great and very reasonably priced (classic burger for nine dollars ) The breakfast there is also very reasonably priced (ten dollars for coffee juice toast and a full cooked breakfast ) The hotel itself is of a very high standard \\x96 the lobby area is very comfortable and stylish and very clean We were very impressed with the size of our room Having stayed in New York Hotels previously and many in London city hotel rooms are generally very small\\x85 We only had a standard room but it was massive The beds were I think queen size and the bed linen (and much commented upon pillows\\x85 ) were very comfortable and in fact I would go as far to say the best bed I have ever had from a hotel We also had a microwave and fridge in our room which were a nice touch but we didn\\x92t use them The air con was a god send in 90 degree heat and having been shown how to switch it off (found it silent at night\\x85 just use the control panel on the actual metal unit on the left hand side to set the fan speed and switch off completely) and the thermostat on the wall controls the temperature The bathroom was ample size and very very clean (I\\x92m quite fussy over bathrooms and this had nothing to complain about) My only slight moan would be that the bath towels could have been bigger but they did leave you 4 of them so more than made up for size in quantity The elevator is slow at times but that\\x92s only because at 9am in the morning you get a lot of people checking out filling the lift with cases and it takes a while\\x85 If you can\\x92t handle a five minute wait \\x96 you are missing out on a great hotel We found it quite nice the way guests would talk in the elevator or whilst waiting for it rather a nice touch personally As for noise \\x96 we genuinely didn\\x92t hear anything that caused us any alarm Indeed on some nights we commented it was so quiet we couldn\\x92t believe we were in a city We were on the back of the hotel into the atrium so no road noise There was some slight music noise form the upstairs bar but as we were not in bed at 8pm didn\\x92t bother us\\x85 If you were looking for an early night on a Friday night there could possibly be some noise you may want to consider By way of accommodation \\x96 I could not fault the hotel We got excellent rates on Expedia and I would recommend the Affina to any friends/colleagues coming to New York providing it keeps getting good reviews I would definitely return next year The service we received from the hotel staff was also of a high standard I can\\x92t fault anyone Door staff were excellent the member of staff who carried our bags to the room gave us a tour of the facilities and how to operate the air con (including how to turn it off) how to use the TV fridge ice box lights lamps and microwave\\x85 This saved us so much time The cleaner was never seen or heard but did a great job \\x96 every morning when we got back from breakfast our room was made fresh The reception and concierge were all helpful with our queries Maintenance in particular were very helpful \\x96 when we arrived I had a problem with my hair straighteners (voltage issues\\x85 nothing to do with the hotel) and I wanted to borrow an adapter\\x85 Reception didn\\x92t have any but sent someone up from maintenance to see if they could help after playing around with them he went to get an adapter for me\\x85 Although it still didn\\x92t work it was just excellent service helping me with something that wasn\\x92t even the hotel\\x92s problem In the end it couldn\\x92t be fixed so they directed me to the nearest shop to buy some (on a Sunday evening) We also had maintenance change lamps in the room which we hadn\\x92t even reported as broken because the cleaning staff had noticed a bulb out\\x85 My only suggestions about how the hotel could be improved are to make Wi-Fi free (or at least have pc's in the lobby with free acess to the internet I only wanted to quickly check emails or facebook and it was thirteen dollars a day or sixty nine for the week way too much Also tea or coffee making facilities in the room would have been most welcome Whilst im sure if we had asked they would have provided them it would have been nice to be able to make a cuppa in the morning All in all \\x96 whilst we didn\\x92t spend that much time in our room as we were out exploring whilst in New York on a tiring week if your hotel is awful it really can ruin your entire trip \\x96 so I am very pleased that all the research I put in to find a great hotel paid off and we had an excellent stay\\x85 My summary is that it is an excellent value hotel great rooms and facilities and helpful staff P S \\x96 I can highly recommend Rossini\\x92s restaurant on 38th Street between Lexington and Park\\x85 It is very old school new york with a pianist most nights and only 2 min walk from the hotel It was wonderful



            " Perfect Hotel in the perfect location Stayed for 6 nights in July Ok here it goes\\x85 hope this is useful\\x85Hotel 41 is a modern boutique type hotel Staff are all young and friendly and there is none of the uncomfortable \\x93poshness\\x94 of some of the other New York hotels yet service is not slack The front door is always opened for you and you will always be wished a good day Nothing is too much trouble for the staff who can offer excellent advice on local restaurants and amenities etc\\x85 1) Location \\x96 incredible You really can not ask for a better or more central location The heart of Times Square (i e centre of the universe) is literally only a 30 second walk away and the hotel is down a side street just off Times Square so you don\\x92t get any of the noise or bustle As mentioned in other reviews there is a major subway station 20 seconds walk from the hotel which has all the main routes (N Q R W S 1 2 3 &amp 7 lines) Turn right out of the hotel and Macy\\x92s is a direct 10 minute stroll down the street and the Empire State is another 10 minutes on from this Port Authority Bus Station is a 2 minute walk (maybe less) and from here you can catch buses direct to all the major airports \\x96 this costs $15 ($27 round trip) and buses leave/arrive every 20 minutes all day I was going to get a taxi until I found out about this service \\x96 it is so reliable and cheap I\\x92d recommend you do this The Rockerfeller Centre is nearby also (can\\x92t remember how far but I recall it is only about a 20 minute walk) All this means that you can easily pop back 2 or 3 times a day just to drop off your shopping without it spoiling the day or having to go out of your way 2) Rooms \\x96 after reading reviews here about the size of the rooms I rang ahead to the hotel and upgraded to a superior room so I can only comment on this Note that if you book through expedia you will only get a standard room We had room 202 which was on the front of the hotel so had a view of the street It is my understanding not to expect good views from any of the rooms and there is at least one room whose view is directly onto a brick wall just a few inches away Bear in mind that all you will do in the room is sleep and change so this doesn\\x92t really matter Our room was very clean with new sheets and towels every day The cleaners seemed to spend at least 40 mins in each room Air conditioning was excellent \\x96 the room was always nicely chilled I found the room a good size with enough room to manoeuvre comfortably even with two cases and many bags of shopping on the floor (bear in mind there is no where in the room to stow away cases) There is a good sized digital safe The bathroom was really nice and modern \\x96 all glass and white tiles with a huge mirror and good lighting It was a good size but there is only one small glass shelf for toiletries A good TV and DVD player is in every room and should you be bored there is a free DVD rental service available from the lobby Our room was really quiet as we had no neighbours and the lobby was below There is an iron and ironing board in every room and the superior rooms each have a full sized fridge (left empty for your own drinks) \\x96 I don\\x92t know if standard rooms have this There is no mini-bar (a good thing ) People reviewing here seem to go on about the Aveda bath products that are complimentary in the bathroom but these seemed nothing special and were just as those you get in any hotel \\x96 mini soap shampoo shower cap etc\\x85 Note that the beds aren\\x92t as big as you might expect for a double \\x96 anyone who is around 6\\x92 tall will find their feet hanging out of the bottom of the bed 3) Services \\x96 complimetary breakfast is served in the smart and modern bar area from 7 to 11am There was no variation but I found the food to be excellent \\x96 bagels mini Danish pastries mini scones mini muffins and plenty of tea coffee iced water and orange juice plus a free copy of The New York Times The buffet never runs short on food and it is constantly restocked so don\\x92t worry if you only get there at 10:50 \\x96 you wont go hungry When you check out (12:00 noon) the hotel will store your bags free of charge until you are ready to pick them up Upon arrival in the lobby you will receive a nice bottle of ice cold water We arrived an hour early for check-in (officially 3pm) but we were shown straight to out room Summary \\x96 9 out of 10 (only for want of a bigger bed) I really genuinely can\\x92t fault this hotel the rooms the location\\x85 all perfect Staying here was the icing on the cake for a great holiday Stay here before everyone else discovers it and the prices go up I hope this is useful to anyone considering staying here Enjoy

            " Wonderful hotel What a great place to stay plain and simple My girlfriend and I just got back from a 5-night vacation in New York City and we had stayed at this location We went there because of price and the positive reviews on this site I knew that I wanted to minimize my costs in NY while staying at a decent hotel so this place fit the bill So let's get on with this review and I'll try to detail it as well as possible since I just got back from there today (it's still fresh in my mind) The lobby area is elegant enough Nice marble floors give way to the concierge and the dining room which is used for the abundant breakfast items (nothing fancy but there are bagels doughnuts apples bananas various cereals strawberry yoghurt and coffee I'm not sure if I'm missing anything since I ate there 2 of the 5 nights there only ) There is a small exercise room up the hall a bit with a treadmill a bicycle machine and I believe a stairmaster Overall good lobby amenities Nothing out of the ordinary but what is there it's done well We stayed on the second floor in the back The view was nothing to write home about simply facing a brick wall Beware as very little light comes through the black-out curtains and the brick walls We wanted to wake up early and go sight-seeing but since no real amounts of light made it into the room we had a hard time getting up since we were so comfortable and lazy in our cozy bed Of course that does ensure that you get a good night's rest as there is very little noise and light that comes into your room The room ameneties are excellent for what they are Quite a large decent TV with about 35 channels A comfortable queen-size bed A nice chair and table Drawers A beautiful painting hung over the bed Just little things that you can find in every hotel and done well here as well The furniture as far as I can tell however was not run down or did not seem that it would break in an instant a good sign The bathroom was excellent having a shower stall and a modern-looking basin There is a hair dryer in there as well Water from the shower was good cold and hot and the pressure was good The rooms were kept spotless which I was thankful for Clean towels every day Clean sheets every day Amenities replaced as needed such as new soap bars Vacuumed every day It was wonderful because I cannot live without cleanliness I've heard horror stories about some other hotels and I'm glad this isn't one of them The cleaning lady was one of the sweetest lady I've ever met You'll know her when you see her She is so sweet in that little accent of hers telling us when our room would be ready again and always greeting us warmly whenever she saw us This was a nice touch especially when you meet lots of people in the city who are too rushed or care too little for niceties This warmthness also extended to some of the staff members but she was definitely the person that stuck out in my head Oh and so is the guy who encourages you to eat breakfast heartily He just keeps encouraging to take food He was also a nice guy Staff at the front were friendly and helpful for the one time I asked for help and that was how to take the subway to get to the airport So I can't really comment on that They seemed generally friendly though always ready to answer questions that you had Overall a great value hotel Clean rooms are important to me and this had them Oh yes and there was plenty of space to move freely around the room It's not a big room but it's a big-enough room to be comfortable enough I loved it here and will most definitely stay here again Highly recommended

            " Truly the Best Showers in NYC I booked Chambers Hotel due to its proximity to St Regis My parents were joining my sister &amp me in NYC a few days after we arrived and we wanted to stay somewhere close so it would be easier for us to change hotels when they got here We spent 4 nights in a standard queen room at Chambers and I have to say I love this little boutique hotel We arrived fairly late at night and the check in was swift and efficient The only problem we had was attempting to spot the almost non-existent hotel name signage from a moving cab but thankfully we recognized the entrance from the photos The lobby was small but cosy with a modern fireplace and stairs that led up to the mezzanine I LOVE the large industrial style elevators and even though we were going to bring the bags up ourselves the concierge appeared and he brought it up for us a few minutes later With only 6 rooms to a floor it was always quiet and I must admit I never saw another guest on our floor The hallway was dimly lit and had interesting art pieces on the walls I also loved that the room numbers were on the floor although it may confuse the first time visitor Even though we booked the smallest room (and I was expecting it to be extremely tiny from the traveler photos here) I was surprised to find that it was actually quite spacious and very nicely decorated A longish corridor led from the room door passing an empty space for your luggage an ottoman a closet and the bathroom to the main room area which had a hidden mini-fridge flat-screen tv console glass desk armchair and queen bed And I absolutely loved the details The industrial style lighting was awesome the desk chair unique there was a solid wood mini side-table next to the armchair and a roll of drawing paper on the desk with colour pencils to scribble with til your heart's content The room had so many lighting features which made it easy to light the room exactly how you want it and it was definitely bright enough to do some reading in bed There is no centralized control system though so you do have to flick the switch on and off manually (though the main lights have a switch by the bed) but I felt the old-school switch plates just added to the cool industrial chic feel of the hotel Our bathroom didn't come with a tub but we didn't mind It was small but still a decent size with enough space to move around without knocking into anything The sink was nice and large and if I did have to make a complaint it would be that the sink didn't have a stopper so there was no way to collect water There is also no lock on the door so that may or may not be a concern depending who you're traveling with The shower itself was absolutely fantastic though and I wish I could take it home with me However there's only a partial shower screen so the water does tend to splash a bit The water temperature is also fairly hot so you'll want to turn it down as cold as it can get and work your way up from there Another thing to take note as well is that the hooks and railings are pretty high up I'm 5'1&quot and had no problems but if you're three or more inches shorter that might be a bit of an issue Also the bathroom could use a fan or blower of some sort to help with the ventilation It gets really steamy in the bathroom when you're showering with hot water the mirror gets fogged and it gets densely humid Other than that I loved the fact that the bathroom floor wasn't cold even though it was almost freezing out The bed was firm and comfortable and the room had french windows you could open to let some fresh air in although the view of the office building behind wasn't something you'd want to gaze at all the time We ordered room service once and I have to say the food was good The restaurant was closed for renovation while we were there and we didn't try the free continental breakfast so I have no comments on that But there are lots of food options all around so you really won't go hungry Service was also very good There was only one staff who seemed a little less friendly but she was still nice and courteous it's just that everyone else was super nice and cheerful all the time Housekeeping was also very good although they stopped giving us our free bottled water and chocolates on the last couple of nights because we hadn't consumed them I'm sure they would have topped it up if we had though Also they didn't refill the used up toiletries (perhaps we didn't stay long enough for the cycle) but they did have lovely fresh towels everyday There was also a slight billing issue when we noticed a $20 room service charge that wasn't ours but they rectified the situation and removed it from the bill once we informed them Location wise this hotel is fantastic Just a minute from all the shops and sights of Fifth Avenue and even Times Square is only a 15 minute walk away The subway is a couple of streets away too and it was generally very easy to get around The street is a little dark at night though but it's very safe although garbage collection happens out front every late night (it doesn't stink though) around 11ish or so Overall i really enjoyed staying at Chambers and actually miss the hotel I wish we could have stayed right through instead of having to shift to St Regis halfway through our trip Hopefully I'll be back

            " Excellent hotel in good location with good service I agree with other reviewers here This is a great hotel Te location on 8th Avenue/49th street in Midtown Manhattan is great Times Square is a five minute walk away Rockerfeller Center a little further down We also walked to Bloomingdales Madison Square Garden Macys and Central Park and took in everything around those areas The subway entrance is opposite If you fancy a bit of boutique shopping in Soho the ACE trains take you downtown in minutes and down to the financial district for the WTC site Battery Park and the ferries Facilities nearby include Starbucks just about anywhere you turn outside the hotel A supermarket open until midnight on the next block and a 24 hour chemist opposite which also sold a selection of groceries Restaurant row is 3 blocks away and we found some great restaurants there Reasonably priced and for us Brits an absolute bargain There also a number of bars with good happy hours The hotel is your standard business hotel affair The lobby area is small don\\x92t expect a soaring atrium style lobby like some other similar chain hotels It could become congested if a large tour group arrived There is a small seating area with complimentary tea and coffee The concierge sits there There is also a 24h shop which sells a selection of tourist tat along with sweets snacks and drinks Vending and ice machines are also on every floor Staff were efficient and pleasant throughout We arrived at midnight and were given our keys with only a credit card swipe for any incidentals required Bell hop was friendly and asked questions and gave us advice We were also greeted with a hello or a nod whenever we left or arrived at the hotel Only negative on the staff front was the concierge who we asked to arrange a transfer back to JFK Her price was too steep I used the internet and got a quote at half the price $48 for those who want to know Rooms have all you need and are functional Don\\x92t expect boutique hotel this is your standard business hotel room Pluses were a fridge rather than a mini-bar in room safe and iron/ironing board Free wireless internet was superb It allowed me to do all the research I needed to do for our trip I know that New York has a reputation for small rooms This hotels rooms are Asian hotel sized ie big In fact they could have put a sofa or an armchair in the spare space as there wasn\\x92t one Only downside would be the smallish but otherwise fine bathroom and that they don\\x92t change the bedding daily (although they will do it if you ask)Some people have mentioned noise but there is no issue It\\x92s normal NY street noise ie horns and sirens which you will get elsewhere Windows were double glazed and muffled most of it anyway If you wanted quiet then New York City is perhaps not the place There is a restaurant attached to the hotel It\\x92s a great little find and judging by the amount of the people who come straight off the street it\\x92s a popular place for the locals too Breakfast is the highlight If you can get a B&amp B rate then you get a special Hilton menu with five choices But this menu is great The breakfasts are huge and of course come with free flowing coffee There is standard menu which has a larger selection and if your rate does not include breakfast then take this menu and have breakfast here because it\\x92s great Staff were also very efficient and pleasant There are sometimes queues but don\\x92t be put off The turnover of tables is swift and you never have to wait that long to be seated We never tried dinner but the menu looked quite good and the place was always busy We did however drink at the bar and found the prices of the imported alcohol a bit steep even for us Brits There was better value to be had only moments way Overall a good stay with nothing to quibble about Would recommend on the strength of the location the efficient and pleasant staff and of the breakfast in the

            " Large room + comfortable beds + helpful staff + great deal = happy customer I was in New York with a friend April 29-May 1st and we were looking for a comfortable hotel within walking distance of the major sites - and a reasonable price After much deliberation we chose the Affinia Manhattan We booked an incredible deal on Travelzoo for $119/night for a Studio room We arrived via taxi from LGA and the hotel is super easy to find - it's kiddie-corner from Penn Station The lobby is lovely with lots of marble and chairs to hang out in Check in took only minutes and we were up in our room Our room was a corner room on the 25th floor and we had two very comfortable double beds with nice linens a desk a chair a mini-kitchen (full-sized fridge small stove small sink small counter area and dishes/pans/glasses) a large closet (plus a coat closet) and a tiny bathroom We were very pleasantly surprised with how much room we had So much room that we were able to take the ironing board out and leave it out our entire stay Try that at other NY hotels The bath was really small - definitely a one-person at a time bath But the tile was updated we had a window that opened and let in natural light and the shower worked great Oh and they have Aveda products As I mentioned the beds were very comfy and the linens were crisp (but soft) - and I'm really picky about my bed and linens Outside of the room we didn't spend much time at all in the neighborhood We heard the place next door (Niles) was good but we didn't have time to check it out We had lunch at Cafe Europa just up the street one day and we walked to the liquor store about a block or two away to buy some champagne Other than that we walked the 10 or so short blocks to Times Square which we made our home base for starting the day You literally walk out of the hotel and take a right onto Seventh Avenue and you will run right into Times Square Don't be scared by the 10 blocks it really is a quick walk We walked to Times Square the Circle Line dock Central Park Rockefeller Center etc I think we only took a cab twice our entire stay The location was also super convenient for us when we left as we walked right across the street to Penn Station where we caught a train to Long Beach As far as service is concerned the ladies at the concierge desk were very helpful and gave us great tips on restaurants and shows They have room service which was pretty speedy even though the only thing I was ordering was a champagne bucket and glasses Sometimes you get an attitude if you don't order food The bellman were helpful with luggage and hailed a cab if we needed it Overall the room itself it a little tired and probably needs an update but it was clean and comfortable and an amazing value I wouldn't have minded paying more it was that good We were really happy with our whole stay and there is nothing I can complain about For us we took the $100/night more we would have paid for a mediocre room close to Times Square and spent it on a show and a nice dinner We never had a problem with noise like others mention in their reviews but maybe it was because we were on a high floor if you aren't looking for luxury and just want a nice clean convenient place to stay do yourself a favor and give the Affinia Manhattan a try My bet is you won't be disappointed

            " Fantastic Budget Hotel We stayed at the Carlton Arms for 3 nights in May 2005 We paid $85 per night including taxes for a room with a shared bathroom The moment we walked in the door we knew it was going to be a great place to stay Every square inch of the hallways and common areas is decorated with really unique artwork and you just get a really great vibe from the place as soon as you walk in There are also two really cute cats who hang out in the lobby We arrived quite early in the morning and we were given two options: take one of the two rooms that was available (with not-so-great art) or store our bags go to the diner around the corner for breakfast and come back around 11 or 11:30 (check-out time) to have a greater selection of rooms We wanted a room with really nice art so we decided to wait We ended up with room 15D which wasn't the best artwork but was good enough Our room had pictures of old-fashioned Asian lovers (you'll have to look at the pictures to see what I mean) and flowers everywhere Our room was tiny but clean When I say clean I mean that it was obvious that it had been cleaned but there was still the kind of grime that is a part of every old building the kind that doesn't go away after you clean it That didn't bother us but some people might not like it We didn't see any sign of a single insect or roach anywhere We were sharing a bathroom but our room had a sink in it which was nice The bed was a reasonably comfortable double bed with clean sheets The room also had a closet a small dresser (not so clean inside) a chair and a small shelf and that's about it Towels and soap were provided If we wanted our towels or sheets changed at any time during our stay we were told to simply ask and it would be done One last thing about our room - it was on the 4th floor so it was quite a hike up the stairs after a long day of walking around NYC However we had our choice of several rooms and chose this one as we didn't mind the walk up the stairs Some less energetic people might not like that though In sum it was a great room for us - small but clean with a comfy bed and unique artwork Perfect for people who want to come back to the hotel and crash after a long day exploring the city but someone who likes to spend time in their hotel room probably wouldn't like it (it's a bit cramped no tv etc) We didn't have any problems with noise in our room (either from pipes banging or from other guests) although at one point our room did smell smoky as though someone in the next room was smoking and it came into our room) The bathroom was really clean - you could tell that they cleaned it a lot because the wastepaper basket was almost always empty and it always smelled fresh The toilet was very clean and there was lots of toilet paper The shower was clean as well - usually I am grossed out by shared showers but this one was fine It takes FOREVER for the water to warm up if you are the first to use it in the morning (like 10 minutes literally) but once it's warm it stays that way and is a nice shower Our bathroom on the 4th floor (D floor) was really funky - see the photos I also used the bathrooms on the other floors and they were clean as well We didn't have to wait much to use the bathrooms but if it is occupied and you don't want to wait it is easy enough to go to a different floor There are 4 floors each painted/decorated with a different theme Take the time to wander around the hotel and take it all in It's great Of all the areas of the hotel the hallways tend to be a bit dirty - they could definitely use a good vacuuming Didn't bother us though - it wasn't that bad The people who worked in the hotel were friendly and very helpful We pestered them with all kinds of questions about where to eat which train to take to get to various places how does one get the subway to the airport etc and they were happy to help with everything There is internet available in the lobby ($1 for 5 minutes) which was really helpful for us There are also 2 payphones in the lobby The hotel is in a great location It's right next door to a college and it's in a decent neighborhood so you feel very safe It's an easy 2 or 3 block walk to the subway which takes you anywhere you need to go There are also a lot of pubs and restaurants in the area To summarize we thought the hotel was great It was very unique and unlike anywhere we've ever stayed (and we've travelled a lot ) However it is not for everyone If you are not used to staying at budget hotels if you are an absolute neat-freak or someone who likes everything shiny and new if you are offended by somewhat risque artwork or if you need a phone and a tv in your room and your bed made everyday this place won't be for you However if you are a bit adventurous not too fussy appreciative of interesting artwork and you like the unconventional this place is definitely for you We will stay here every time we go to NYC

            " Very nice experience - have a plan for breakfast We planned our visit for the 3 days following Xmas - knowing this would be a busy time we booked ahead We wanted someplace quiet but within 15 minutes of the funspots Using the Embassy Suites own webpage we clicked the &quot internet deals&quot tab and was happy to commit to a rate of $189 a night The only requirement was that there was a no-refund policy This ALMOST bit us as the transit strike was not resolved until the 23rd We parked the car in New Haven ($8 a day)and took Metro-north into the city Booking in advance and using off-peak rates: 2 adults a 13 years old and a 5 years travelled roumd trip of $89 DIRECTIONS: From Grand Central Station ($2 one trip pass or $7 all day pass) take the #4 train to Courtland Street (** there are three Courtland Street stations - the one on the # 1 train is closed **) the #4 train will drop you off at the church where the 9/11 rescuers rested and the place you will remember as the tall black iron fenceline with all the photos of the missing It is all clean now and there is a nice memorial inside the church When you exit the station head west (towards the back of the church) about 300 feet and you will see the PATH train station (NJ bound) in front of you If you turn left the white building is &quot Century 21&quot - reportedly the number 1 high-end clothing discount location in the world Fortunately the hotel is to the right follow the fenceline of the PATH around the corner and it will lead you to a modern covered walkway which leads right to the hotel As you take this walkway the footprint of the WTC will be on your left There is an esclator and an elevator so really no UP stairs When you have crossed over West Street (4 lane roadway) you are at the end - follow the stairs ahead of you down On your left is the American Express Building and the site of a nice shopping mall The hotel is the brown building at your 2 o'clock position You may notice the movie theather signs first It was about a 5 minute walk with bags not a single complaint from either the 13 or 5 year old Enter the glass doors and take the esclator up into the atrium of the hotel - as you walk towards the other side you will pass the evening reception / breakfast buffet room The main hotel bank of elevators are to your right through the glass doors BUT check in first downstairs You can leave the others in the nice chairs or have them see the waterfall and continue across to the down esclator The front desk will be to your right While there notice the wall mounted flatscreen TV - to its right is the 6 station (free) internet access Immediately behind that is a little store and a hidden entrance to a great Asian Resturant with a nice take-out service EXPERIENCE: We arrived around 11:30 am and intended to check our bags as we were headed to Broadway for a 2:30 show when the well groomed and attentive desk staff advised us that if we didn't mind staying on the second floor ( we had been booked on the 15th ) we could check in now Room 232 was located on the main floor and allowed us to avoid using the elevators and placed us on the same floor as the drinks and food Not a bad thing for a man and the world class NYC Fitness club was also accessable from the end of our hall We were suprised at the amount of space nice 12' high ceilings and the feel of upscale appointment The main room consisted of a sofa/couch a cushioned chair and coffe table The TV was nicely sized for the room and stored within a cabinet To the left of the TV was a table and 3 chairs set aside for dining There is also a wet bar with a food prep area and undercabinet microwave The room lacks a refrigerator but I understand what a cleaning nightmare those must be for housekeeping (I had heard a rumor that if you ask they will bring one up to your room ) The living area is separated from the bedroom by a cool frosted glass wall and door This room has a king sized bed It displayed (5) full down-pillows and 1 body pillow which was 4 feet long The mattress was one of the most comfortable we have enjoyed anywhere in the world The room has a great view of the Hudson River and the New Jersey Skyline Our 5 year old fell asleep on the nice sitting area in front of the windows later that night The room came with one terry-cloth robe and again a nice sized TV in a multi-funtion cherry cabinet The bathroom was very clean it had Bath &amp Beautyworks supplies and the offer if any items were left at home (razor / shaving cream / toothbrush / toothpaste / comb ) that they would provide free of charge at the desk You can't beat that The room is equipped with the traditionals such as coffee maker and hairdryer the bathroom night light was welcomed as I forgot to bring ours We never heard our neighbors no hall noise and not a sound from the street so we were very happy with the hotel construction design BUFFET PLAN OF ATTACK: It was a very busy time and the hotel was at full occupany even with the posted times for stress-free buffet eating it was alittle crazy If you find it busy when you go a simple 3-prong attack works best Have someone secure a table The &quot eggs made to order&quot line only provides eggs nothing else so one person goes there with multiple orders The buffet line has multiple stations overload a plate or two with stuff your doctor probably doesn't need to know about - bacon sausage and potatos and have your own buffett at the table After the food portion of the line skipping the line is allowed - return for the juice/drinks and silverware There is a seperate area at the end of the serving are for fruits breads bagels pancakes cereals This is the bargin of the century - a breakfast of this quantity &amp quality anywhere else in New York would easily be $25 a person Same goes for the mangers reception every night quality drinks and snacks nice room and fun music a chance to meet other people for around America or the world for the price of a tip We found it easy TO GET AROUND from the hotel While the metropass allows bus use and the M20 does stop nest to the hotel and go to Times Square - it was a long wait but a GREAT ride through the neat neighboorhoods along the way it was night and christmas - more than once we commented on how fun it would be to have alittle place here The bus was not a time effective way to travel though From the hotel to TIMES SQUARE you can either take a $2 taxi to the #1 train @ Chambers Street (walkable - but lots of traffic and very dark at night) or HEARLD SQUARE/ROCKERFELLER CENTER - Walk to the back of the church (across from the PATH) and take the #RNQ or W train to Herald Square and transfer to the # BD F and V To get to 59TH STREET area or up the line to YANKEE STADIUM walk to the church and take the #4 train (Courtland Street) If you want to get to COLUMBUS CIRCLE PORT AUTHORITY BUS TERMINAL or PENN STATION walk to the PATH station itself and follow the signs to the # AC or E train CENTRAL PARK is easily accessed this way to also Including Columbus Square the next 6 stops exit into the park and the upscale Central Park West Back at the hotel you will find a very safe &amp clean walking path along the river and a super CHILDREN's play area both are located only 300' out the door by the front desk esclator We were not willing to spend half a day or more to view the Statute of Liberty and a local let us in on the best HIDDEN JEWEL in NYC We took a $5 taxi which took us thru the upscale Battery Park City past the unbelieveable line of people standing in line for the tour (blocks long) and to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal This ultra-modern building has a nice store and we quickly boarded the FREE ferry to the island - wonderful views of the Brooklyn and Verrazano Bridge's water traffic in the harbor and you pass both Ellis Island and the Statute The 20 minute ride was relaxing with plenty of photo op's and it was big fun for our 5 year old Upon our arrivial we simly exited the ferry and got back in line for the FREE return trip We sat next to a tour group and learned alot from their guide All told it was an hour round-trip We noted while in Staten Island the presence of the New York Yankee minor league park which faces the skyline - will have to return for a nightgame the views must be stunning We have nothing but positive things to say about the Embassy Suites - NYC nice clean and spacious room great price (still not sure why we got such a low price reasonable access to transportation and a nice quiet spot in NYC WE WILL BE BACK we also had a nice experience at another ES in Deerfield Beach FL (next to Boca Raton) - right on the beach great pool billion dollar views all beach toys floats provided at no charge twice daily complimentary chilled orange slices delivered pool and beach side Similar breakfast buffet and happy hour the internet rate there was only $159 Enjoy

            " An Average City Hotel Stayed here mid-February 09 for a city break in New York Firstly the location of this hotel is very very good Easily accessible by subway as 51 St/Lexington Ave station (which is served by the E Train which runs to/from JFK Airport) is right outside the main entrance It's also walking distance from The Rockefeller Center and only a little further to Times Square and Broadway The reception area of the hotel is attractive and modern and the reception staff were friendly and efficient in checking us in and out The signature DoubleTree welcome cookies were an extra treat and very tasty (still warm too) We were allocated a standard twin room on the sixth floor The room was an average size for a city hotel and was functional but a little tired in places Whilst all the surfaces were very clean it was evident that the furniture was quite worn There was also some evidence of dampness in some patches on the ceiling by peeling paint particularly in the bathroom A picture above one of the beds in the room also had some very minor graffiti written in biro on it Another minor issue is that whilst we didn't have a problem with traffic noise (our room looked over a quiet side-street) noise does travel inside the building particularly through the walls from guests in neighbouring rooms or walking past in the corridor Despite these 'niggles' though the beds were very comfortable with clean bed linen and nice soft pillows A review here reports bed-bugs but we never found any during the four nights we stayed there The bathroom and towels were also clean The temperature and water pressure in the shower is just right too The large HD TV in the room was a great bonus with a reasonable selection of channels Also liked the 'View on Demand' feature where you could 'rent' movies using the on-screen menus Only other thing that would have been nice in the room was tea/coffee making facilities rather than having to go to the cafe outside the hotel to buy it One other minor complaint was that house-keeping weren't very consistant in their timings They came every day but one day our room wasn't serviced until gone 8pm in the evening Whilst we didn't have dinner in the hotel restaurant we found that the breakfast buffet was expensive and so only used it on our first morning However this wasn't a problem as New York is full of small coffee shops and cafes that serve very nice breakfasts so you only have to go for a little walk to find something Lastly the hotel Concierge were extremely helpful in organising some great activities and entertainment during our stay in New York So overall I recommend the DoubleTree Metropolitan for business travellers and the tourist who like to go out and explore most of the time who's just looking for a place to sleep If you like a bit of luxury this probably isn't for you It's in a great location and is clean and comfortable Just needs a lick of paint here and there

            " So disappointing We'd stayed at The Algonquin over 20 years ago &amp we were pleased to go back as we had fond memories of our time there The first thing we noticed (how could you not) is that it is now attached to a building site The noise starts at 7 15am &amp goes on most of the day It is incredibly noisy &amp we were lucky we were on the other side of the building from the works Our one bedroom suite was spacious &amp clean However the air conditioner was so noisy it was like having a combine harvester in the room The bed was classified as a queen but it was closer to a double &amp was soft &amp we kept rolling into the middle so we had 5 terrible nights sleep The plumbing was antiquated The bath plug is outside the bath &amp very unhelpfully the instructions on how to use it were by the television in the sitting room The shower ran hot &amp cold &amp so for 5 days we were either scalded or frozen by the shower The toilet required an engineering degree to work - if you didn't operate it properly effluent came back up - really distasteful There was no ventilation in the bathroom &amp it felt airless &amp unpleasant the products were awful - infact we went out &amp bought some for ourselves The staff with one of two exceptions (the doorman on the morning shift our cleaner &amp one of the bellmen) were completely uninterested &amp unhelpful The food was only ok Oh &amp I almost forgot for most of our stay only 1 elevator worked The hotel needs a complete overhaul &amp management needs to remember it's in the hospitality business                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.776779\n",

            " Pretty Good Place - A Hidden Gem I travel to New York City quite frequently so I have had a chance to stay in a few different hotels I always look by price first then I come to this website to read the reviews &amp view the pictures I stumbled upon this place quite by accident - and I must say I was extremely pleased by reading the reviews to find a great well known hotel at a fair price close to the theatre district Penn Station shopping &amp Times Square I paid $199 a night for a king bed (which is considerably nice compared to the other prices I came across for the area) Upon arrival I was greeted by a very courteous front desk who asked me if I preferred two doubles (I signed up for the king because that was all that was avaiable online - so being offered the doubles was quite nice ) The lobby was small but nicely decorated Complimentary coffee &amp tea all day long but it wasn't from carafes sitting there all day - they had a lovely machine that dispensed the tea &amp coffee fresh Nice well stocked mini store was available too &amp not too expensive for New York Good security arriving back at night - they asked to see the room key &amp did so politely Rooms were very good sized - lots of room Beds were amazingly soft &amp stocked with abt 6 pillows each Linens were fresh &amp clean &amp soft All things I love because I am a very uneasy hotel person - I cringe at the slightest bit of poor housekeeping but in the bedroom area I was quite comfortable Great job there Now keep in mind that I am extremely squeamish when it comes to hotel bathrooms &amp I kept this for last - I have to have a bathroom that feels practically new &amp this wasn't the case It was clean - don't get me wrong but I'm just used to bathrooms that I've stayed in other hotels in NEw York &amp they have been completely done in glossy tiles to have that &quotfresh &amp new&quot feel To me I feel having these tiles gives me a cleaner feeling than wallpaper &amp while the wallpaper in the bathroom was for the most part clean I would have preferred it done in tile - floor to wall to feel comfortable Plus the sink top had chips in it &amp that was a little unappealing to me too Also the ceiling above the tub looked to have what I thought was mold on the white ceiling (I tried not to think abt it as I showered) - &amp this grayish patches on the white wasn't just a little it was quite a bit in my opinion There was also a mini frig under the sink in the bathroom which is nice to have but my water would be frozen solid in the morning &amp I couldn't find any way to turn it down - plus a little unappealing having the fridge down under the sink by the toilet The floor had like paver colored tiles that were quite dated &amp the grout didn't have that new feeling Also when drying our hair in the morning we blew a fuse &amp half the room lost power Called the front desk twice to have fixed - very nice man quickly got on it the second time &amp followed up with a call to make sure it was on If they update these bathrooms this hotel no doubt will be higher on the list of hotels than #8 - it truly is a nice friendly affodable convenient hotel I will go back    0.761847\n",
            " So pleased I stayed here I stayed here for 3 nights in March &amp booked this hotel after reading the positive reports on Trip I was travelling alone &amp had friends staying in a nearby hotel I have asked permission of those named below to include them by name I arrived after 7pm &amp was warmly welcomed by Richard Thank you I was on the 2nd floor in the 'Troy Donahue' room which was facing the street The room was clean &amp quirky with huge posters I had chosen a room with sink &amp shower but without toilet The loo was just along the corridor &amp I never saw anyone else go in or out It suited me fine The bed was very large &amp very comfy The only slight drawback was that as the bed was so large it was near the far end wall &amp I had to siddle past Having said that it was great to have a big bed The shower was efficient &amp towels replaced daily as needed The complimentary toiletries were most welcome The breakfasts were good &amp set me up for the day There was a choice of orange juice coffee various teas 2 types of cereal fruit muffins doughnuts bagels &amp cookies The plates were fab All themed around filmstars &amp movies I'm a saddo &amp I took photos of my plates each day having chosen different ones each morning My friend arrived to collect me on the first morning &amp I had asked Richard the night before if it would be ok if my friend had a coffee &amp cookie with me I would happily pay if he would added it to my bill He said there was no need &amp my friend would be welcome What a warm gesture &amp much appreciated Each evening when I returned to the hotel Richard was on duty &amp we had great chats He was really helpful over all sorts of info I wanted to know Thank you again The other guests were quiet but we passed the time of day On the last morning I went to reception to ask if I could check in for my flight Ric (not Richard) was on duty I hadn't met him before Another total sweetie He happily helped me to check in using his computer &amp then printed off the confirmation sheet for me at no cost I also met Jay the owner on my last morning again another really warm helpful guy When I was ready to leave he helped me with my bags &amp hailed a cab for me Thank you I really appreciated the warmth shown to me by Richard Ric &amp Jay They made a good stay GREAT I would return The location was excellent with the subway at the end of the street a minute walk away All the cab drivers knew of the location which is a bonus If you like a good location &amp quirkiness then stay here There was redecoration going on but every establishment has to maintain a property It didn't interfer with my stay at all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.755005\n",

            " Great hotel- excellent location My husband and I just returned from New York and a 3 night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square We really enjoyed this hotel Typically when we have gone to NYC in the past we have stayed at &quot W&quot hotels in Times Square and Union Square so I was a bit concerned that we wouldn't like this hotel I was completely wrong The King room was spacious and well appointed The bed was comfortable and upscale I am a Hilton Gold Member so we had a free breakfast at Pigalle every morning which had many options (yay- no buffet ) Internet access was free They have a nice free business center and a 24 hour market pantry The location is right near restaurant row the subway and Times Square It is far enough away that it is fairly quiet We were on the 11th floor and heard no street noise at all I would definitely stay here again    0.398498\n",
            " Nice but not great The rooms in this hotel are a lot smaller than in the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square on 8th Avenue and also the location is not as good so my advice would be to stay at the Times Square hotel instead as it is cheaper has bigger rooms and is in a better location Despite all this this is still a reasonable hotel The rooms were clean and the location wasn't terrible (6 blocks from Macys and Penn Station) but not as good as the Hilton Garden Inn at Times Square                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.373456\n",

            " Hotel 41 - Excellent Location Recommended We stayed at Hotel 41 from 23rd Feb - 1st March in room 305 The location of this hotel really is excellent It is a 2 minute walk to the heart of Times Square with a subway directly opposite the front door The rooms although are small were not as small as others on this site have made them out to sound The room was decorated well and had a nice modern feel to it The pictures on the hotels website were exactly what the room looked like The rooms were well equipped with a TV DVD player fridge free safe access 2 large drawers wardrobe hanging space a bookcase an ironing board and iron and a powerful hairdryer There was plenty of space for us to store everything The room was immaculate and the maids came in every day and changed the beds and left clean white fluffy towels A white luxurious bath robe was also provided for use Beds were comfortable and two pillows were supplied which allowed for a comfortable nights sleep The rooms have air conditioning/heater which can be a little noisy The bathroom is small and yes space to put your things on is limited with only one small glass shelf for all your toiletriesbut it is ample for what you need The shower was lovely immediately hot and powerful and I did not want to get out The Aveda products were a nice touch and smelt lovely The bathroom overall was immaculately clean and well lit with a massive mirror - perfect except it was a little on the small side maybe Our room had no view our window faced a brick wall The only drawback with this was that we had to go have a look in the window down the corridor to determine what the weather was like No problem for us but if you want a room with a view then this isn't the hotel for you Breakfast consisted of bagels muffins and pastries Tea coffee hot chocolate and orange juice were also availiable Bagels could have done with some stratwberry jam but thats only a personal preference The breakfast was enough to keep us going throughout most of the day but we did have breakfast else where on the 4th day for a bit of variety Some people have commented on the noisy lift bell which is true The &quot ding&quot of the lift bell can be heard when you are in the room which didn't bother me as a heavy sleeper but did bother my boyfriend who can hear a pin drop People in the corridor walking past your door could also be heard - but no noise could be heard from the theatre next door I would definately stay here again The staff were very helpful and friendly and above all the location of this hotel was excellent The rooms and bed were comfortable and the whole hotel was always immaculately clean It was excellent value for money and the hotel was recommended on the BBC's Holiday Programme on Thursday night    0.371120\n",

            " very very good for the price I went there for 3 nights with my girlfriend and really enjoyed our stay We stayed in a room with a shared bathroom wich is shared by only one other room I booked using hostelbookers (297$US for 3 nights) and everything was ok no problem no booking mistake The rooms are very small and intimate Small sink small tv everything is small but quite cute The room was very clean the maid came everyday and we never saw her The bathroom was also cleaned very oftenly I never got in a dirty shower No bugs no dirt nothing wrong The conditionning air is very noisy but worked fine There is no kind of free breakfast in this hotel and I'm not sure that there's an internet access It is not a place where you'll hang around and where you'll do activities If you just go there to take a shower and sleep its very great It is situated in a very safe burrough of Manhattan and its close to everything by walk : 8 minutes from Time Square 3 streets from Empire State Building There is no better deal in Manhattan be sure of it if you're in a budget                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0.319153\n",
            " Clean and comfortable for budget travellers We stayed in the Deauville for three nights at the end of Sept 2006 I was a little nervous about what it would be like having read unfavourable reviews of others hotels in New York Luckily I was pleasantly surprised to find it clean and comfortable Our room had one double bed hanging space with hangers tv bedside tables chest of drawers and towels provided As budget travellers we opted for a shared bathroom and were pleased to find a sink in our room The bathroom was next door and also spotlessly clean We had a daily housekeeping service and heard vacuuming every day The Deauville is also in an excellent location (walking distance to Empire State Building and Times Square) and I felt safe in the area at night The only small thing that was wrong was that our room got quite warm and the air-con very loud so we couldn't have it on at night and the window faced a brick wall about 2-3 feet away Being on the third floor this meant practically no natural light reached the room However for some people this may be a plus It also made the room quieter than I expected for New York All in all we enjoyed our stay at the Deauville: it is fairly basic but good value for money and most importantly clean The staff were pleasant and I would definitely stay there again It is not the kind of hotel you'd spend a lot of time in but who's going to stay indoors when on holiday in New York anyway                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.317695\n",

            " Very Small rooms but excellent location What the reviews say about the rooms being small is not a lie Seriously over small rooms not really suitable for a couple who are intent on shopping like we did But that said if its a bed you are looking for then it is fine all be it small The room we had however small done the job for us It was clean bathroom was spotless though the only view we had from our bedroom window was a brick wall The bar downstairs was very convenient esp the 1st night we arrived as it was very late and it was nice not to have to go too far for a night cap Staff were very accomodating and helpful no complaints there The continental breakfast was adequate enough to get you started in the mornings And as far as location goes its excellent right on the doorstep of Times Square For short term visits I would definately recommend this hotel even if the rooms are small The time we spent in our room was minimal and while it was cramped we made the most of it It was clean and thats all that concerned us                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.311409\n",
